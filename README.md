Classifier for Research Articles

This is a classifier that uses Naive Bayes Classifiers to classify research articles into the following categories:
Artificial Intelligence,
Computer Vision,
Neural Networks,
Parallel Computing,
Robotics,
Information Security,
Computer Networks,
Discrete Math,
Computational Geometry,
Computer Networks


We create a dictionary of words and count the occurences of each words from the dictionary in every article to 
create the feature of data points(articles).
Then we pass these features along with a label to the Classifier.
Testing: We pass the features and the classifier gives back a label.

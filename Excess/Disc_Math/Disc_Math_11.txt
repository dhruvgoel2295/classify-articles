abstract
Identifying codes have been introduced in 1998 to model fault detection in multiprocessor
systems. In this paper, we introduce two variations of identifying codes: weak codes and
light codes. They correspond to fault detection by successive rounds. We give exact bounds
for those two definitions for the family of cycles.

1. Introduction
Identifying codes are dominating sets having the property that any two vertices of the graph have distinct neighborhoods
within the identifying code. Also, they can be used to uniquely identify or locate the vertices of a graph. Identifying codes
have been introduced in 1998 in [11] to model fault detection in multiprocessor systems. Numerous papers already deal
with identifying codes (see e.g. [13] for an up-to-date bibliography). A multiprocessor system can be modeled as a graph
where vertices are processors and edges are links between processors. Assume now that at most one of the processors is
defective, we would like to locate it by testing the system. For this purpose, we select some processors (constituting the
code) and have them test their r-neighborhoods (i.e. the processors at distance at most r). The processor sends an alarm if
it detects a fault in its neighborhood. We require that we can, with these answers, tell if there is a faulty processor and, in
this case, locate it uniquely. This corresponds exactly to finding an identifying r-code of the graph of the system.
Assume now that a processor can restrict its tests to its i-neighborhood for i ∈ [[0, r ]]. Then, we can have a detection
process by rounds: at the first step, the selected processors test their 0-neighborhoods, then they test their 1-neighborhoods,
. . . , until the r-neighborhoods. We stop the process when we can locate the faulty processor. We introduce in this paper weak
r-codes (resp. light r-codes) that will model this process without memory, i.e. to identify a faulty processor at the round i, the
supervisor does not need to remember the collected information of the rounds j < i (resp. with memory, i.e. to identify a
faulty processor at the round i, the supervisor needs to remember the collected information of the rounds j < i) and study
them for the family of cycles.
Let us give some notations and definitions. We denote by G = (V , E ) a simple nonoriented graph having vertex set
V and edge set E. Let x and y be two vertices of G. The distance d(x, y) between x and y is the number of edges of a
shortest path between x and y. Let r be an integer. The ball centered on x of radius r, denoted by Br (x) is defined by
Br (x) = {y ∈ V | d(x, y) ≤ r }.

An r-dominating set of G is a subset C ⊆ V such that ∪c ∈C Br (c ) = V . This means that each vertex of G is at distance at
most r of a vertex of C . We say that a subset C ⊆ Vr-separates x and y if and only if Br (x) ∩ C ̸= Br (y) ∩ C (we will also say
in this case that ‘‘x and y are separated by C for radius r’’ or that ‘‘x is separated from y by C for radius r’’). A set Cr-identifies
x if and only if it r-separates x from all the other vertices.
(1) Identifying r-code. An identifying r-code of G is an r-dominating set C ⊆ V that r-identifies all the vertices:

∀x ∈ V , ∀y ̸= x ∈ V ,

Br (x) ∩ C ̸= Br (y) ∩ C .

(2) Weak r-code. A weak r-code of G is a r-dominating set C ⊆ V such that each vertex x is rx -identified by C for some radius
rx ∈ [[0, r ]]:

∀x ∈ V , ∃rx ∈ [[0, r ]],

s.t. ∀y ̸= x ∈ V ,

Brx (x) ∩ C ̸= Brx (y) ∩ C .

(3) Light r-code A light r-code of G is a r-dominating set C ⊆ V such that each pair (x, y) of vertices is rxy -separated by C for
some radius rxy ∈ [[0, r ]]:

∀x ∈ V , ∀y ̸= x ∈ V , ∃rxy ∈ [[0, r ]],

s.t. Brxy (x) ∩ C ̸= Brxy (y) ∩ C .

Fig. 1 gives an example of a weak 2-code of P5 (elements of the code are in black, as in all the figures). Indeed, vertices

v3 and v4 are identified for radius 0, vertices v2 and v5 are identified for radius 1 and vertex v1 is identified for radius 2. But
this code is not an identifying 2-code of P5 : vertices v2 , v3 , v4 and v5 are not separated for radius 2. Fig. 2 gives a light 2-code
of P5 which is not a weak 2-code: vertex v2 is separated from vertex v1 only for radius 0 and for this radius, vertex v2 is not
separated from v3 .
A code C is said to be optimum if its cardinality is minimum. We denote by ICr (G) (resp. WCr (G), LCr (G)) the cardinality
of an optimum identifying (resp. weak, light) r-code. An identifying r-code is a weak r-code and a weak r-code is a light
r-code. This implies the following inequality: ICr (G) ≥ WCr (G) ≥ LCr (G). For all graphs and for any r, there exist a weak
r-code and a light r-code (using for instance all the vertices as the code), whereas this is not true for identifying codes.
Let us now give some bounds for weak codes.
Theorem 1. Let r and k be two integers and wr (k) be the maximum order of a graph G such that G has a weak r-code of size k.
We have:

wr (k) = k + r (2k − 2).
Proof. First, we construct a graph Hrk in the following way (see Fig. 3 for r = 4 and k = 3). The graph Hrk has vertex set
C ∪ I1 ∪ ... ∪ Ir where C = {1, . . . , k} and Ij has size 2k − 2 for 1 ≤ j ≤ r. Each vertex of Ij corresponds to a non-empty
strict subset of {1, . . . , k}. Each vertex of I1 is linked to the vertices of C that form its subset, and each vertex of Ij for j > 1 is
linked to the vertex of Ij−1 that corresponds to the same subset. Furthermore, C induce a clique in Hrk . The graph Hrk has order
k + r (2k − 2) and one can check that C is a weak r-code of Hrk (a vertex of Ij is identified for radius j). So wr (k) ≥ k + r (2k − 2).
Now let G be a graph and C be a weak r-code size k of G. Let us try to maximize the number of identified vertices for each
radius i ≤ r.

• For radius 0, only the k vertices of C can be identified.

Fig. 4. Notation of the proof (Lemma 1).

• For radius 1, at most 2k additional vertices can be identified (one for each subset of C ). However, it is not possible to have
all the subsets. Indeed, all the elements of {B1 (c ) ∩ C | c ∈ C } cannot be used to identify a vertex not in C for radius 1.
If 2k − 1 additional vertices are identified at radius 1, that means that {B1 (c ) ∩ C | c ∈ C } contains only one element,
which is necessarily the whole set C . Then all the strict subsets of {1, . . . , k} are used to identify a vertex for radius 1, in
particular, one vertex is identified by the empty set and so is not 1-dominated by C . As the set C must be an r-dominating
set, then r ≥ 2. Furthermore, if we try to add a new vertex x in G, then necessarily, B1 (x)∩C = C and x will not be identified
for any radius. So, G has order k + (2k − 1) and r ≥ 2. A contradiction with the bound wr (k) ≥ k + 2(2k − 2) for r ≥ 2,
given by the construction of the graph H2k . It follows that at most 2k − 2 additional vertices are identified for radius 1 in G.
• For radius 2 ≤ i ≤ r, using a similar process, we can show that at most 2k − 2 vertices are identified at round i.
Summing the number of identified vertices at each round, we obtain that G has order at most k + r (2k − 2). It follows
that wr (k) = k + r (2k − 2).
Light r-codes are related to other locating notions: a light 1-code is a 1-locating dominating code [7] for which we require
that only pairs of vertices not in the code are 1-separated by C . The notion of light r-codes is a generalization of the notion
of metric basis. A subset C of vertices is a metric basis if every pair of vertices of the graph is separated by a vertex of C for
some radius (there is no bound on the radius). The metric dimension of a graph G, denoted by dim(G), is the cardinal of a
minimum metric basis. A light r-code is a metric basis, so LCr (G) ≥ dim(G). If r is greater than the diameter of G, i.e. the
largest distance between two vertices of G, then a light r-code is exactly a metric basis. For a detailed review about metric
basis, see [6]. As for metric basis, we do not have good bounds of the extremal size of a graph that has light r-codes of size k.
The optimization problems of finding optimum identifying codes [5] and optimum metric bases [12] are NP-complete.
Finding optimum light codes is also NP-complete because if r is larger than the diameter of the graph, then it is equivalent
to metric bases. Therefore, identifying codes and metric bases have been studied in particular classes of graphs (see
e.g. [1,3,4,9]).
For cycles, although metric bases problem in cycles is not difficult (the dimension of a cycle is 2), the case of identifying
codes is not as easy: the complete study of cycles has just been finished in [10] after numerous contributions (see
e.g. [2,8,14]). We focus on the case of weak and light r-codes.
In this paper, we give exact value for WCr (Section 2) and LCr (Section 3) for the class of cycles. In weak codes, we assign a
radius to each vertex to separate it from other vertices whereas we can assign up to r + 1 radii to a vertex with light r-codes.
We show that 3 radii per vertex is actually sufficient to separate it from all the other vertices. We address in Section 4 the
question of the optimum size of a code requiring only 2 stored radii per vertex.
2. Weak r-codes of cycles
In the following, we will denote by Cn the cycle of size n and by {v0 , v1 , . . . , vn−1 } the set of its vertices. We first assume
that n ≥ 2r + 2.
Lemma 1. Let S be a set of 2r + 2 consecutive vertices on Cn . If C is a weak r-code of Cn , then S contains at least two elements
of C .
Proof. Without loss of generality, S = {v0 , v1 , . . . , v2r +1 }. Assume S contains a single element of the code, say a = vi ,
w.l.o.g. i ≤ r (see Fig. 4).
We focus on the vertices x = vr −1 , y = vr and z = vr +1 . Then, Br (y) ⊆ S and Br (z ) ⊆ S. Let t = d(a, y) = r − i.
For all r ′ ∈ [[0, t − 1]], Br ′ (y) ∩ C = Br ′ (z ) ∩ C = ∅. For all r ′ ∈ [[t + 1, r ]], Br ′ (y) ∩ C = Br ′ (z ) ∩ C = {a}. Hence ry = rz = t.
It follows that Bt (y) ∩ C = {a} must be different from Bt (x) ∩ C . Hence, Bt (x) ∩ C must contain an element different from a,
say b. Necessarily, b ̸∈ S, this implies t = r and z is not r-dominated, a contradiction.
A first bound of WCr (Cn ) directly follows from Lemma 1.
Corollary 1. Let C be a weak r-code of Cn . Then |C | ≥ ⌈n/(r + 1)⌉.
Proof. In Cn there are n different sets S of 2r + 2 consecutives vertices. If C is a weak r-code, by Lemma 1, there are at least
2 vertices of the code in each set S. Each vertex of the code is counted exactly 2r + 2 times, so |C | ≥ ⌈2n/(2r + 2)⌉ =
⌈n/(r + 1)⌉.
In the following, we set n = (2r + 2)p + R, with 0 ≤ R ≤ 2r + 1 and p ≥ 1 (by assumption, n ≥ 2r + 2). Then Corollary 1
can be reformulated as: if C is a weak r-code of Cn , then we have

• if R = 0, then |C | ≥ 2p;

• if 1 ≤ R ≤ r + 1, then |C | ≥ 2p + 1;
• if r + 2 ≤ R ≤ 2r + 1, then |C | ≥ 2p + 2.
Lemmas 2–4 give some constructive upper bounds. Moreover, Lemmas 2–5 provides exact values of WCr (Cn ).
Lemma 2. If n = (2r + 2)p, then Cn has a weak r-code with cardinality 2p = n/(r + 1); moreover, this code is optimum.
Proof. We construct the code by repeating the pattern depicted by Fig. 5. More precisely, let C = {vi | i ≡ r [2r + 2] or
i ≡ r + 1 [2r + 2]}. The set C has cardinality 2p. The set C r-dominates all the vertices of Cn . Let rvk = r − k if k ∈ [[0, r ]]
and rvk = k − (r + 1) if k ∈ [[r + 1, 2r + 1]] (the indices of the vertices of Cn are taken modulo 2r + 2). Then for all pair of
vertices vk , vl , k ̸= l, we have Brvk (vk ) ∩ C ̸= Brvk (vl ) ∩ C . Hence C is an r-dominating set that rvk -identifies the vertex vk . It
follows that C is a weak r-code. This code is optimum by Corollary 1. Fig. 6 gives an example of such a code in C12 .
We can easily extend this construction to the general case.
Lemma 3. If R = 1, then Cn has a weak r-code with 2p + 1 elements. If 2 ≤ R ≤ 2r + 1, then Cn has a weak r-code with 2p + 2
elements. These codes are optimum for R = 1 or R ≥ r + 2.
Proof. Let R = 1 and C = {vi | i ≡ r [2r + 2] or i ≡ r + 1 [2r + 2]} ∪ {vn−1 }. Then C is a weak r-code of Cn and |C | = 2p + 1.
(See Fig. 7.)
Assume now that R ≥ 1 and take for code C = {vi | i ≡ r [2r + 2] or i ≡ r + 1[2r + 2]} if R ≥ r + 2 and C = {vi | i ≡ r [2r + 2]
or i ≡ r + 1[2r + 2]} ∪ {vn−2 , vn−1 } otherwise. Then C is a weak r-code of Cn .
In some cases, the aforementioned codes are not optimum.
Lemma 4. If (r , R) = (1, 2), then Cn has an optimum weak 1-code of cardinality 2p + 1. If (r , R) = (2, 2), then Cn has an
optimum weak 2-code of cardinality 2p + 1.
Fig. 8 (resp. Fig. 9) shows an example of an optimum weak r-code for (r , R) = (1, 2) (resp. (r , R) = (2, 2)).
Proof. For (r , R) = (1, 2), the set C = {vi | i ≡ 0[2]} is a weak 1-code: each vertex x in the code is 0-identified by C and
each vertex x not in the code is 1-identified by C . For (r , R) = (2, 2), the set C = {vi | i ≡ 0 [6] or i ≡ 2 [6]} is a weak
2-code. The optimality of these codes is shown by Corollary 1.
The next lemma shows that the lower bound of Corollary 1 is not sharp for 2 ≤ R ≤ r + 1 and (r , R) ̸= (1, 2) or (2, 2),
this implies that in these cases, codes of Lemma 3 are optimum.
Lemma 5. If 2 ≤ R ≤ r + 1 and (r , R) ̸= (1, 2) or (2, 2), then Cn does not have a weak r-code of cardinality 2p + 1.

Fig. 9. An optimum weak 2-code of C8 .

Fig. 10. Notation of the proof (Lemma 5).

Proof. Assume that there is a weak r-code C of Cn of cardinality 2p + 1. First, observe:
(O.1) In a set of R consecutive vertices of Cn , there must be at most one vertex of C . Otherwise, in the rest of Cn , there are at
most 2p − 1 vertices of the code in a set of (2r + 2)p consecutive vertices which contradicts Lemma 1. In particular
there is no pair of consecutive vertices of C .
(O.2) For similar reasons, in a set of 2r + 2 + R consecutive vertices of Cn , there must be at most 3 vertices of C .
Let M be the maximum size of a set of consecutive vertices not in C and let SM be a set of M consecutive vertices not in C .
We know by (O.1) that M ≥ R − 1. Moreover M > 1; indeed, if M = 1, then R = 2 and the code is exactly one vertex over
2, so |C | = 2n = 2p + 1, n = 4p + 2 and (r , R) = (1, 2).
Let us denote c1 and c2 the two elements of the code bounding SM , let S1 and S2 be the two maximal sets of consecutive
vertices not in C who are before c1 and after c2 , and finally c0 and c3 the two vertices of the code who are before S1 and after
S2 (see Fig. 10).

• Observe that p ≥ 1, so C has cardinality at least 3 and observe by (O.1) that S1 and S2 are not empty. Hence, the elements
c1 , c2 , c3 may be supposed distincts and so on for elements c0 , c1 and c2 , but note that c0 and c3 may denote the same
vertex.
• Observe by (O.1) that |S1 | ≥ R − 1, |S2 | ≥ R − 1, M ≥ R − 1. Let us denote S the set S1 ∪ {c1 } ∪ SM ∪ {c2 } ∪ S2 .
• Observe that |S | ≥ 2r + 3. Indeed, if c0 and c3 are different vertices, then {c0 } ∪ S ∪ {c3 } is a set with 4 vertices of the
code, so, by (O.2) |S | + 2 > 2r + 2 + R ≥ 2r + 4. If c0 and c3 denote the same vertex, then S ∪ {c3 } = V (Cn ), p = 1 and
|S | = n − 1 = 2r + 1 + R ≥ 2r + 3.
So there are three consecutive vertices x, y, z in S such that {Br (x) ∪ Br (y) ∪ Br (z )} ∩ C ⊆ {c1 , c2 } and y ∈ SM .
To separate y and x, ry must be d(x, c1 ) or d(y, c2 ). To separate y and z, ry must be d(y, c1 ) or d(z , c2 ). Therefore, either
ry = d(x, c1 ) = d(z , c2 ), or ry = d(y, c2 ) = d(y, c1 ). In all cases, M is odd and y is the middle element of SM , so
d(y, c1 ) = d(y, c2 ). As M ̸= 1 then M ≥ 3 and (x, z ) ∈ SM × SM .
Let dy denote d(y, c1 ) in the following. Let w be the vertex just before x. Then Br (w) ∩ C ⊆ {c0 , c1 , c2 }. To separate x from
y, rx must be d(y, c2 ) = dy or d(x, c1 ) = dy − 1. To separate x from w , rx must be d(w, c1 ) = dy − 2 or d(x, c2 ) = dy + 1
or d(w, c0 ). Necessarily, we have rx = d(w, c0 ). This implies d(w, c0 ) = r because d(w, c0 ) = d(x, c0 ) − 1 ≥ r and rx ≤ r.
Since dy ≤ r and rx = dy or rx = dy − 1. It follows rx = dy = r. Therefore M = 2r − 1, |S1 | = 1, and finally R = 2. With
similar arguments for z, we obtain the situation depicted by Fig. 11.
Consider (r , R) ̸= (1, 2) or (2, 2) and R = 2, then r ≥ 3 and so M ≥ 5. Let v1 and v2 be the two consecutive vertices
in SM following c1 (see Fig. 11). We have d(v2 , c2 ) = M − 1 > r and d(v1 , c2 ) > r so v1 and v2 can only be separated by
elements of the code on the left of v1 and v2 . Let rv1 be the radius that identifies v1 . There must be an element of the code
at distance exactly rv1 of v1 to separate v1 and v2 , and for similar reasons, there must be an element of the code at distance

rv1 + 1 of v1 to separate v1 from c1 . This implies that two elements of the code are consecutives vertices in Cn , which
contradicts (O.1).
We are now able to compute WCr (Cn ) for all n ≥ 2r + 2. Our results are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Let r be an integer and n = (2r + 2)p + R, with 0 ≤ R ≤ 2r + 1 and p ≥ 1, we have:
(i) if R = 0, then WCr (Cn ) = 2p,
(ii) if R = 1 or if r ≤ 2 and R = 2, then WCr (Cn ) = 2p + 1,
(iii) otherwise, R ≥ 2 and (r , R) ̸= (1, 2) or (2, 2), then WCr (Cn ) = 2p + 2.
The following lemma completes the study for the small cases.
Lemma 6. Let r and n be integers with 3 ≤ n ≤ 2r + 1, then WCr (Cn ) = 2.
Proof. The code cannot be a single vertex, otherwise its two neighbors are not i-separated for any i, so WCr (Cn ) ≥ 2. Two
adjacent vertices form a weak r-code for any r, so WCr (Cn ) = 2. Note that if n is odd, the antipodal vertex to the code in the
cycle is identified by the empty set.
3. Light r-codes of cycles
We now study light r-codes of the cycle Cn . In this section, we will first assume that n ≥ 3r + 2 and we will study the
small values of n at the end of the section.
Lemma 7. Let C be a light r-code of Cn and c an element of C . There is another element of the code C at distance at most r + 1
of c.
Proof. Let x and y be the neighbors of c. As C is a light r-code, there is an integer rxy such that 0 ≤ rxy ≤ r and
Brxy (x) ∩ C ̸= Brxy (y) ∩ C . There consequently exists a vertex c ′ ∈ C such that, w.l.o.g., c ′ ∈ Brxy (x) and c ′ ̸∈ Brxy (y).
Moreover, c ̸= c ′ because d(x, c ) = d(c , y) = 1. It follows that d(c ′ , c ) ≤ d(c ′ , x) + d(x, c ) ≤ rxy + 1 ≤ r + 1.
Lemma 8. Let S be a set of 3r + 2 consecutive vertices on Cn . If C is a light r-code of Cn , then S contains at least two elements
of C .
Proof. Let C be a light r-code of Cn . Let us assume there is a set S of 3r + 2 consecutive vertices of Cn containing only one
element c of C . w.l.o.g., we denote S = {v0 , v1 , . . . , v3r +1 } and c = vi with i < 2r. By Lemma 7, there is an element c ′ at
distance at most r + 1 of c. But c ′ ̸∈ S so necessarily, c ′ ∈ {v−1 , v−2 , . . . , v−(r +1) } and i ≤ r. Then v2r +1 is not r-dominated
by any element of C , a contradiction.
It follows from Lemma 8.
Corollary 2. Let C be a light r-code of Cn . Then |C | ≥ ⌈2n/(3r + 2)⌉.
In the following, let n = (3r + 2)p + R with 0 ≤ R ≤ 3r + 1 and p ≥ 1 (by assumption, n ≥ 3r + 2). Then Corollary 2 can
be reformulated as: if C is a light r-code of Cn , then we have

• if R = 0, then |C | ≥ 2p,
• if 0 < 2R ≤ 3r + 2, then |C | ≥ 2p + 1,
• otherwise, 2R > 3r + 2, and |C | ≥ 2p + 2.
We want to exhibit some optimum codes.
Lemma 9. If n = (3r + 2)p, then Cn has a light r-code with cardinality 2p. Moreover this code is optimum.
Proof. We construct the code by repeating the pattern S depicted by Fig. 12. More precisely, let C = {vi | i ≡ r [3r + 2] or i ≡
2r + 1 [3r + 2]}. Set C is a r-dominating set of size 2p and we just need to check that every pair of vertices is separated by C for
some radius in [[0, r ]]. It is sufficient to prove it for all pairs (vi , vj ) in the pattern S, i.e. with (i, j) ∈ [[0, 3r + 1]] × [[0, 3r + 1]].
W.l.o.g. we study the case i < j, and we define rij as follows:

• if j ≤ r, then rij = r − j;

1954

O. Delmas et al. / Discrete Mathematics 311 (2011) 1948–1956

• if i ≤ r < j, then rij = |(2r + 1) − j|;
• if r < i ≤ 2r, then rij = i − r;
• if i ≥ 2r + 1, then rij = i − (2r + 1).
Then, 0 ≤ rij ≤ r and it is easy to check that (vi , vj ) is rij -separated by C . So C is a light r-code of Cn with cardinality 2p. This
code is optimum by Corollary 2.
We generalize this construction.
Lemma 10. If 1 ≤ R ≤ r + 1, then Cn has a light r-code of cardinality 2p + 1. If R > r + 1, then Cn has a light r-code of
cardinality 2p + 2.
Proof. Consider the three following cases: (1) R ∈ [[1, r + 1]], (2) R ∈ [[r + 2, 2r + 2]], and (3) R ∈ [[2r + 3, 3r + 1]]. For
each case, we define the code C as:
(1) C = {vi | i < (3r + 2)p, i ≡ r [[3r + 2]] or i ≡ 2r + 1 [[3r + 2]]} ∪ {v(3r +2)p }.
(2) C = {vi | i < (3r + 2)p, i ≡ r [[3r + 2]] or i ≡ 2r + 1 [[3r + 2]]} ∪ {v(3r +2)p , v(3r +2)p+r }.
(3) C = {vi | i < (3r + 2)p, i ≡ r [[3r + 2]] or i ≡ 2r + 1 [[3r + 2]]} ∪ {v(3r +2)p+r , v(3r +2)p+2r }.
These sets are light r-codes of cardinality 2p + 1, 2p + 2 and 2p + 2, respectively.
Lemma 11. If R > r + 1, then Cn has no light r-code of cardinality 2p + 1.
Proof. Assume that there is a code C of cardinality 2p + 1. First observe that in a set S of R consecutive vertices, there is at
most one element of the code C . Otherwise, there will be only 2p − 1 elements of the code in the rest of the cycle which
can be divided in p disjoint sets of size 3r + 2. One of this set will have only one element of the code, a contradiction by
Lemma 8.
Now, take an element c of the code C , by Lemma 7 there is a vertex c ′ of the code at distance d ≤ r + 1 of c. Take the
set S of all vertices between c and c ′ , c and c ′ included. S has cardinality at most r + 2 ≤ R and has two vertices of C , a
contradiction.
Our results are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 3. Let r be an integer and n = (3r + 2)p + R, with 0 ≤ R < 3r + 2, and p ≥ 1, we have:
(i) if R = 0, then LCr (Cn ) = 2p;
(ii) if R ≤ r + 1, then LCr (Cn ) = 2p + 1;
(iii) otherwise, R > r + 1 and then LCr (Cn ) = 2p + 2.
Theorem 3-i (resp, 3-ii, 3-iii) follows from Lemma 9 (resp. Corollary 2 and Lemma 10, and from Lemmas 10 and 11).
The next lemma completes the study for the small values of n.
Lemma 12. Let r and n be integers with 3 ≤ n ≤ 3r + 1, then LCr (Cn ) = 2.
Proof. A light r-code cannot be a single vertex otherwise the neighbors of the element of the code are not i-separated for
any i. Two adjacent vertices form a light r-code for any n ≤ 2r + 2. For n > 2r + 2, take two vertices at distance r + 1.
With light r-codes, we can assign up to r + 1 radii to a vertex to separate it from all the other vertices. Actually, for cycles,
we just need three radii.
Proposition 1. Let C be a light r-code of Cn and x be a vertex of Cn . Assume that n > 2r + 1. There is a subset Rx of [[0, r ]] of
size at most 3 such that for all other vertices y of Cn , there is rxy ∈ Rx such that Brxy (x) ∩ C ̸= Brxy (y) ∩ C .
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that x = v0 .
Assume first that there exist two vertices of the code, say a = vi and b = vj , such that −r ≤ i ≤ 0 ≤ j ≤ r (if x ∈ C , then
we have a = b = x). Thus Rx = {d(x, a), d(x, b)} separates x from all the other vertices: vertices x and vk are separated for
radius d(x, a) if 0 < k < n/2 and for radius d(x, b) if −n/2 < k < 0.
Otherwise, let a = vi be the element of the code closest to x. We can assume that 0 < i ≤ r. By Lemma 7 we know that
there exists another element of the code b = vj such that i < j and j − i ≤ r + 1. Then x is separated from all vertices not in
Bi (a) by radius i, and from all vertices in Bi−1 (a) by radius i − 1. It remains one vertex, v2i , that is separated from x for radius
d(v2i , b) ≤ r. Finally the three radii i, i − 1, d(v2i , b) are enough to separate x from all vertices.
This proposition leads to the following question: what is the size of an optimum light r-code on Cn that need to assign
only 2 radii to each vertex? We solve this question in the next section.
4. Codes with 2 radii
A (2, [[0, r ]])-code C of a graph G is a subset of vertices of G that r-dominates every vertex and such that for each vertex
x, we can assign a set Rx = {rx , rx′ } of integers in [[0, r ]] such that every pair of distinct vertices (x, y) is rx or rx′ -separated
by C .

Fig. 13. The pattern S for a (2, [[0, r ]])-code of the cycle Cn with n multiples of s (cf. Lemma 13).

Lemma 13. Let k = ⌊(r + 1)/3⌋ and s = 3r − k + 2. If s divides n, then the code defined by repeating the pattern S depicted
by Fig. 13 is a (2, [[0, r ]])-code of Cn .
Proof. We focalize on a pattern S. Denote by c0 and c1 the two vertices of the code of S and assume that c0 = v0 . Then
c1 = vr −k+1 and the vertices of S are the vertices between v−r and v2r −k+1 . Partition the vertices of S in five subsets:
A1 = {v−r , . . . , v−k−1 }, A2 = {v−k , . . . , v−1 }, A3 = {v0 , . . . , vr −k+1 }, A4 = {vr −k+2 , . . . , vr +1 } and A5 = {vr +2 , . . . , v2r −k+1 }.
If r = 1, then A2 and A4 are empty; if r = 0, then A3 is non-empty and the other sets are empty. Let x be a vertex of S. Let Rx
the set of radii associated to x:

•
•
•
•
•

= {d(x, c1 ), d(x, c1 ) − 1};
= {d(x, c1 ), d(x, c2 ) − 1};
= {d(x, c1 ), d(x, c2 )};
= {d(x, c1 ) − 1, d(x, c2 )};
= {d(x, c2 ), d(x, c2 ) − 1}.
One can check that Rx ⊂ [[0, r ]] in all cases. By symmetry, we just need to check that every vertex x of A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 is
if x
if x
if x
if x
if x

∈ A1 , then set Rx
∈ A2 , then set Rx
∈ A3 , then set Rx
∈ A4 , then set Rx
∈ A5 , then set Rx

separated from all the other vertices for a radius in Rx .
If x ∈ A1 , then x is separated from the vertices not in Bd(x,c0 ) (c1 ) for radius d(x, c1 ) and from the vertices in Bd(x,c1 )−1 (c1 )
for radius d(x, c1 ) − 1. Remains the vertex y at distance d(x, c1 ) of c1 . If x = v−i , with k + 1 ≤ i ≤ r, then y = vi and
d(y, c2 ) = r − k + 1 − i ≤ r − 2k ≤ k + 1 ≤ d(x, c1 ) by definition of k. Notice that d(x, c2 ) > d(x, c1 ), so x and y are
separated for radius d(x, c1 ).
If x ∈ A2 , then x is separated from the vertices not in Bd(x,c1 ) (c1 ) for radius d(x, c1 ) and from the vertices in Bd(x,c1 )−1 (c1 )
for radius d(x, c2 ) − 1. That covers all the vertices of the cycle.
One can check by the same kind of arguments that x ∈ A3 is also separated from all the other vertices for d(x, c1 ) or
d(x, c2 ).
Lemma 14. Let C be a (2, [[0, r ]])-code of Cn . Let S be a set of s = 3r − k + 2 vertices with k = ⌊(r + 1)/3⌋. Then S contains
at least two vertices of C .
Proof. For r = 0, the lemma is true as all the vertices must be 0-dominated. The lemma is also true for r = 1, as a (2, [[0, 1]])code is a light 1-code. Now, let r ≥ 2. Notice that 3r − k + 2 > 2r, thus S contains at least one vertex of C . By contradiction,
assume that S contains only one vertex c of C , and w.l.o.g. assume c = v0 . Let v−a be the first vertex of S and vb be the last
vertex of S, a + b = 3r − k + 1. We can assume that a ≤ b. C is also a light r-code so by Lemma 7 a ≤ r, then b ≥ 2r − k + 1.
C is r-dominating so b ≤ 2r, and then a ≥ r − k + 1. We have Br (vk ) ∩ C = Br (vk−1 ) ∩ C = Br (vk+1 ) ∩ C = {c }
because d(vk , v−a ) = a + k ≥ r + 1 and d(vk , vb ) = b − k ≥ 2r − 2k + 1 ≥ r + 1. Then, vk and vk−1 are only
separated for radius k − 1, vk and vk+1 are only separated for radius k. So necessarily vk and v−k must be separated
for radius k or k − 1. That means there is a vertex of the code c ′ ̸∈ S different of c at distance at most k of v−k . But
d(c ′ , v−k ) = d(c ′ , v−a ) + d(v−a , v−k ) ≥ 1 + a − k ≥ r − 2k + 2 ≥ k + 1 (by definition of k), a contradiction.
As corollary, the code of Lemma 13 is optimum and we have the following lower bound, as for light and weak codes.
Corollary 3. Let C be a (2, [[0, r ]])-code of Cn . Then |C | ≥ ⌈2n/s⌉ with s = 3r − ⌊(r + 1)/3⌋ + 2.
It remains the case where s does not divide n, with similar arguments used for light codes, one can show that:
Theorem 4. Let n, r , s, p, R be integers, set k = ⌊(r + 1)/3⌋, s = 3r − k + 2 and n = sp + R, with 0 ≤ R < s. Then the size of
an optimum (2, [[0, r ]])-code of Cn is:
(i) 2p if R = 0;
(ii) 2p + 1 if R ≤ r + 1;
(iii) 2p + 2 otherwise.
5. Perspectives
Section 4 suggests the following definition that will generalize all the previous ones.
Definition 1. Let p be an integer and R be a set of non-negative integers. A (p, R)-identifying code of a graph G = (V , E ) is
a subset C of V such that:

∀x ∈ V , ∃r ∈ R, Br (x) ∩ C =
̸ ∅

∀x ∈ V , ∃Rx ⊂ R, |Rx | ≤ p, ∀y ∈ V , y ̸= x, ∃rxy ∈ Rx s.t.:
(identification)
Brxy (x) ∩ C ̸= Brxy (y) ∩ C .
(domination)

Integer p corresponds to the number of radii we can assign to a vertex to separate it from all the others whereas the
set R denotes the set of radii we can use. This definition unifies all the previous ones: a r-identifying code is a (1, {r })identifying code, a weak r-code is a (1, [[0, r ]])-identifying code, a light r-code is a (r + 1, [[0, r ]])-identifying code, a
r-locating dominating code is a (2, {0, r })-identifying code.
Proposition 1 is equivalent to say that every (p, [[0, r ]])-code in a cycle, with p ≥ 3 is a (3, [[0, r ]])-identifying code.
Sections 2 and 4 consider (2, [[0, r ]])-identifying codes and (1, [[0, r ]])-identifying codes of the cycle, respectively. Hence we
solved the problem of finding an optimum (p, [[0, r ]])-identifying code (for any p) in a cycle. However, the general problem
of finding an optimum (p, R)-identifying codes in the cycle is still unknown.

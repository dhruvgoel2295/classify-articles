abstract
A connected graph Γ with at least 2n + 2 vertices is said to be n-extendable if every
matching of size n in Γ can be extended to a perfect matching. The aim of this paper is
to study the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of certain semi-Cayley graphs of finite
abelian groups, and the classification of connected 2-extendable semi-Cayley graphs of
finite abelian groups is given. Thus the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of Cayley graphs
of non-abelian groups which can be realized as such semi-Cayley graphs of abelian groups
can be deduced. In particular, the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of connected Cayley
graphs of generalized dicyclic groups and generalized dihedral groups are characterized.

1. Introduction
All groups considered in this paper are finite, and all graphs are finite, simple, and undirected. The operation of a group
will be written multiplicatively, except for abelian groups, where it is written additively. For a graph Γ , denote by V (Γ ) and
E (Γ ) its vertex set and edge set.
The concept of Cayley graphs was introduced by Arthur Cayley in 1878 to explain the concept of abstract groups which
are described by a set of generators. Let G be a group and S a subset of G such that 1 ̸∈ S and S −1 = S. The Cayley graph
G(S ) of G with respect to S is a graph with vertex set V (G(S )) = G and edge set E (G(S )) = {xy | x, y ∈ G, yx−1 ∈ S }.
Equivalently, a graph Γ is a Cayley graph if and only if its automorphism group Aut(Γ ) contains a regular subgroup. It is
well known that the Cayley graph G(S ) of a group G with respect to some S ⊆ G is vertex transitive and G acts regularly
on G(S ) as an automorphism group with one orbit. A graph is said to be a semi-Cayley graph of a group G if it admits G as a
semiregular automorphism group with two orbits (of equal size). The following characterization of semi-Cayley graphs is
due to Resmini and Jungnickel [3]. Let A, B, C be subsets of a group G such that A = A−1 , B = B−1 and 1 ̸∈ A ∪ B. Define the
graph SC (G; A, B, C ) to have vertex set G × {0, 1}, and to have vertices (g , i), (h, j) adjacent if and only if one of the following
three possibilities occurs:
(1) i = j = 0 and hg −1 ∈ A;
(2) i = j = 1 and hg −1 ∈ B;
(3) i = 0, j = 1 and hg −1 ∈ C .

Then SC (G; A, B, C ) is a semi-Cayley graph of the group G. Conversely, every semi-Cayley graph can be obtained in this
way [3]. Investigation of semi-Cayley graphs is a part of a larger project which aims at obtaining a deeper understanding of
various classes of symmetric graphs ([7–9,12] and their references). Strong regular semi-Cayley graphs were characterized
in [3] as well as semisymmetry [4], and arc transitivity [7].
A set M of edges of a graph Γ is a matching if no two members of M share a vertex. A matching M is perfect if every
vertex of Γ is covered by an edge of M. Let n ≥ 1 be an integer. A connected graph Γ having at least 2n + 2 vertices is said
to be n-extendable if every matching M of size n can be extended to a perfect matching. The concept of n-extendable graphs
was introduced by Plummer [13] in 1980, and the relationship between n-extendability and other graph properties was
studied [13,14]. The 2-extendable Cayley graphs of finite abelian groups were classified in [1]. In that paper, the problem of
characterization of 1-extendable and 2-extendable Cayley graphs of non-abelian groups was posed. Chen et al. [2] classified
the 2-extendable Cayley graphs of dihedral groups.
A semi-Cayley graph is a natural generalization of a Cayley graph, and a semi-Cayley graph has high symmetry degree.
The class of semi-Cayley graphs of the form SC (G; A, A, C ) of abelian groups contains not only all Cayley graphs of abelian
groups of even order but also some Cayley graphs of non-abelian groups of even order. For example, Cayley graphs of dihedral
groups can be realized as semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ) of some abelian groups [5], and in this paper we shall show that
Cayley graphs of generalized dihedral (respectively, dicyclic) groups can be realized as semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ) of
some abelian groups. Luo and Gao [11] characterized the 2-extendable and 3-extendable semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; ∅, ∅, C )
of finite abelian groups. The aim of this paper is to study the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of semi-Cayley graphs of
the form SC (G; A, A, C ) of abelian groups.
After some preliminaries, in Section 3, the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ) of
abelian groups are studied and the classification of connected 2-extendable semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ) is given.
Thus the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of Cayley graphs of non-abelian groups which can be realized as semi-Cayley
graphs of the form SC (G; A, A, C ) of abelian groups can be deduced. In particular, the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of
connected Cayley graphs of generalized dicyclic groups and generalized dihedral groups are characterized in Section 4.
2. Preliminaries
In this section, we shall list some definitions and known results which will be used in this paper.
Definition 2.1 ([6]). Let Γ1 and Γ2 be two graphs. The Cartesian product Γ = Γ1 × Γ2 of Γ1 and Γ2 is defined as a graph with
vertex set V (Γ ) = V (Γ1 ) × V (Γ2 ) and edge set E (Γ ) = {(u1 , u2 )(v1 , v2 ) | u1 = v1 and u2 v2 ∈ E (Γ2 ) or u2 = v2 and u1 v1 ∈
E (Γ1 )}.
It is known from [6] that the Cartesian product of graphs is commutative and associative.
Lemma 2.2 ([10]). Let Γ1 be a k-extendable graph and Γ2 a graph without isolated vertices. Then Γ1 × Γ2 is (k + 1)-extendable.
Lemma 2.3. Let Pm be a path of length m − 1 with m ≥ 2 and Cn a cycle of length n (Cn = P2 whenever n = 2). Then Cn × Pm × P2
is 2-extendable.
Proof. The proof follows directly from Lemma 2.2 and the fact that Cn × P2 is 1-extendable.
For a Cayley graph G(S ) of a group G, if S = {a1 , a2 , . . . , an }, we denote G(S ) by G(a1 , a2 , . . . , an ). The next lemma gives
the classification of 2-extendable Cayley graphs of abelian groups.
Lemma 2.4 ([1]). Let G(S ) be a connected Cayley graph of an abelian group G of even order (Fig. 1). Then G(S ) is 2-extendable if
and only if it is not isomorphic to any of the following graphs:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

Z2n (1, 2n − 1), n ≥ 3;
Z2n (1, 2, 2n − 1, 2n − 2), n ≥ 3;
Z4n (1, 4n − 1, 2n), n ≥ 2;
Z4n+2 (2, 4n, 2n + 1), n ≥ 1; and
Z4n+2 (1, 4n + 1, 2n, 2n + 2), n ≥ 1.

The following lemma characterizes the 2-extendable semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; ∅, ∅, C ) of abelian groups.
Lemma 2.5 ([11]). Let G be an abelian group and C a nonempty subset of G. Then SC (G; ∅, ∅, C ) is 2-extendable if and only if
|C | ≥ 3.

3. 1-extendable and 2-extendable semi-Cayley graphs
In this section, we shall study the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ) of abelian
groups G. It will be shown that every connected semi-Cayley graph SC (G; A, A, C ) is 1-extendable and the connected 2extendable semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ) will be characterized.
Lemma 3.1. Let SC (G; A, A, C ) and SC (G; A, A, C ′ ) be two connected semi-Cayley graphs of an abelian group G with C =
{c1 , c2 , . . . , cn } and C ′ = {0, c2 − c1 , . . . , cn − c1 }. Then SC (G; A, A, C ) ∼
= SC (G; A, A, C ′ ).
Proof. Let Γ1 = SC (G; A, A, C ) and Γ2 = SC (G; A, A, C ′ ). Define a map φ from V (Γ1 ) to V (Γ2 ) by φ((x, 0)) = (x, 0) and
φ((x, 1)) = (x − c1 , 1) for x ∈ G. Then φ is a bijection. To prove that φ is an isomorphism, let (g1 , i), (g2 , j) ∈ V (Γ1 ). If
i = j = 0, then

(g1 , 0)(g2 , 0) ∈ E (Γ1 ) ⇔ g2 − g1 ∈ A
⇔ (g1 , 0)(g2 , 0) ∈ E (Γ2 )
⇔ φ((g1 , 0))φ((g2 , 0)) ∈ E (Γ2 ).
If i = j = 1, then

(g1 , 1)(g2 , 1) ∈ E (Γ1 ) ⇔ g2 − g1 ∈ A
⇔ (g1 − c1 , 1)(g2 − c1 , 1) ∈ E (Γ2 )
⇔ φ((g1 , 1))φ((g2 , 1)) ∈ E (Γ2 ).
If i = 0 and j = 1, then

(g1 , 0)(g2 , 1) ∈ E (Γ1 ) ⇔
⇔
⇔
⇔

g2 − g1 ∈ C
(g2 − c1 ) − g1 ∈ C ′
(g1 , 0)(g2 − c1 , 1) ∈ E (Γ2 )
φ((g1 , 0))φ((g2 , 1)) ∈ E (Γ2 ).

Therefore φ is an isomorphism.
In view of Lemma 3.1, without loss of generality, we may suppose that 0 ∈ C for any connected semi-Cayley graph
SC (G; A, A, C ). The next theorem gives the 1-extendability of connected semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ) of abelian groups.
Theorem 3.2. Every connected semi-Cayley graph SC (G; A, A, C ) of an abelian group G is 1-extendable.
Proof. Let Γ = SC (G; A, A, C ) be a connected semi-Cayley of an abelian group G and e = (g , i)(h, j) ∈ E (Γ ). If i = 0 and
j = 1, then M = {(x, 0)(h − g + x, 1) | x ∈ G} is a perfect matching of Γ containing e. If i = j = 0, then
M = {e, (g , 1)(h, 1)} ∪ {(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {g , h}}
is a perfect matching of Γ . If i = j = 1, then
M = {e, (g , 0)(h, 0)} ∪ {(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {g , h}}
is a perfect matching of Γ .
Lemma 3.3. Let Γ = SC (G; A, A, {0, a}) be a semi-Cayley graph of a cyclic group G = ⟨a⟩ of order n. Then Γ ∼
= Z2n (S ) with
S = {1, 2n − 1} ∪ {2k | ka ∈ A}.

Proof. Define a map φ : Γ → Z2n (S ) by φ((ka, 0)) = 2k + 1 and φ((ka, 1)) = 2k for k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1. It is clear that
φ is a bijection. To prove that φ is an isomorphism, let u = (k1 a, i), v = (k2 a, j) ∈ V (Γ ) with k1 , k2 ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. If
i = j = 0, then
uv ∈ E (Γ ) ⇔ (k2 − k1 )a ∈ A

⇔ 2k2 − 2k1 ∈ S
⇔ (2k1 + 1)(2k2 + 1) ∈ E (Z2n (S ))
⇔ φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Z2n (S )).
If i = j = 1, then
uv ∈ E (Γ ) ⇔ (k2 − k1 )a ∈ A

⇔ 2k2 − 2k1 ∈ S
⇔ (2k1 )(2k2 ) ∈ E (Z2n (S ))
⇔ φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Z2n (S )).
If i = 0 and j = 1, then
uv ∈ E (Γ ) ⇔ k2 a = k1 a or k2 a = k1 a + a

⇔
⇔
⇔
⇔
⇔

k2 ≡ k1 or k2 ≡ k1 + 1 (mod n)
2k2 − (2k1 + 1) ≡ ±1 (mod 2n)

(2k2 − (2k1 + 1)) (mod 2n) ∈ S
(2k1 + 1)(2k2 ) ∈ E (Z2n (S ))
φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Z2n (S )).

Therefore φ is an isomorphism.
Let Γ be a graph and U ⊆ V (Γ ). Denote by Γ [U ] the subgraph of Γ induced by U. For a semi-Cayley graph Γ =
SC (G; A, A, C ) of an abelian group G, let E1 = E (Γ [G × {0}]), E2 = E (Γ [G × {1}]) and E3 = E (Γ ) \ (E1 ∪ E2 ). An edge
(g , i)(h, j) of SC (G; A, A, C ) is said to be of type a if h − g = a or h − g = −a for some a ∈ A ∪ C .
Lemma 3.4. Let Γ = SC (G; A, A, C ) be a connected semi-Cayley graph of an abelian group G and e1 ∈ E1 , e2 ∈ E2 . If Γ is not
isomorphic to any of the graphs listed in Lemma 2.4, then {e1 , e2 } can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ .
Proof. Let e1 ∈ E1 and e2 ∈ E2 . Since both Γ [G × {0}] and Γ [G × {1}] are isomorphic to G(A), which is vertex-transitive,
without loss of generality, we may assume that e1 = (0, 0)(a, 0) with a ∈ A and e2 = (c , 1)(c + a′ , 1) with c ∈ G and a′ ∈ A.
There are two cases.
Case 1. e1 and e2 have different types; that is, a′ ̸= ±a. Let |a| = n and let m be the smallest positive integer such that
ma′ ∈ ⟨a⟩ and ma′ = la for some nonnegative integer l.
Subcase 1.1. a′ ̸∈ ⟨a⟩, that is m ≥ 2. Let X = Γ [⟨a, a′ ⟩ × {0, 1}]. Then Γ [⟨a, a′ ⟩ × {0}] has a spanning subgraph (for
example, graphs Γ1 , Γ2 in Fig. 2 are such subgraphs) isomorphic to Cn × Pm , where Cn = P2 whenever n = 2. Note that
Γ [⟨a, a′ ⟩×{0}] ∼
= Γ [⟨a, a′ ⟩×{1}] and 0 ∈ C . It follows that X has a spanning subgraph X1 containing e1 which is isomorphic
to Cn × Pm × P2 , where Cn = P2 whenever n = 2.
Let H be a coset of ⟨a, a′ ⟩ in G. Then Γ [H × {0, 1}] ∼
= X . Therefore Γ can be decomposed into a finite number of copies
of X . If e2 ∈ E (X ), then we may choose X1 such that e1 , e2 ∈ E (X1 ). Since X1 is 2-extendable by Lemma 2.3, there is a perfect
matching M of X containing e1 and e2 . Therefore M can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ . If e2 ̸∈ E (X ), then there is a
copy X ′ of X containing e2 . So there is a perfect matching M1 in X containing e1 and a perfect matching M2 in X ′ containing
e2 . Therefore M1 ∪ M2 can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ .
Subcase 1.2. a′ ∈ ⟨a⟩. If {c , c + a′ } ∩ {0, a} = ∅, then
M = {e1 , e2 , (0, 1)(a, 1), (c , 0)(c + a′ , 0)} ∪ {(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a, c , c + a′ }}
is a perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 . If {c , c + a′ } ∩ {0, a} ̸= ∅, then |{c , c + a′ } ∩ {0, a}| = 1 by a′ ̸= ±a. Without
loss of generality, suppose that c = a. Then e2 = (a, 1)(a + a′ , 1), and
M = {e1 , e2 , (a′ , 0)(a′ + a, 0), (0, 1)(a′ , 1)} ∪ {(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a, a′ , a + a′ }}
is the required perfect matching of Γ .
Case 2. e1 and e2 have the same type. In this case, e2 = (c , 1)(c + a, 1) for some c ∈ G. If c ̸∈ {0, a, −a}, then
M = {e1 , e2 , (0, 1)(a, 1), (c , 0)(c + a, 0)} ∪ {(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a, c , c + a}}

is a perfect matching of Γ which contains e1 and e2 . If c = 0, then
M = {e1 , e2 } ∪ {(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a}}
is a perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 . So we may assume that c = a, without loss of generality. Thus e2 =
(a, 1)(2a, 1).
Subcase 2.1. |a| is even. There is a perfect matching M1 of Γ [⟨a⟩×{0}] containing e1 and a perfect matching M2 of Γ [⟨a⟩×{1}]
containing e2 . Since the set of vertices of Γ not in M1 ∪ M2 can be partitioned into a disjoint union of even cycles, M1 ∪ M2
can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ .
Subcase 2.2. |a| is odd.
Suppose that A ̸⊆ ⟨a⟩, and assume that, b ∈ A \ ⟨a⟩. Let X = Γ [⟨a, b⟩ × {0, 1}]. By an argument similar to that for Subcase
1.1, we may show that {e1 , e2 } can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ .
Suppose that A ⊆ ⟨a⟩ and A \ {±a} ̸= ∅, and assume that, ka ∈ A with 1 < k < |a| − 1. If k ≥ 3, then
M = {e1 , e2 , (2a, 0)(2a + ka, 0), (ka, 0)(ka + a, 0), (0, 1)(ka, 1), (ka + a, 1)(ka + 2a, 1)}

∪{(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a, 2a, ka, ka + a, ka + 2a}}
is a perfect matching of Γ which contains e1 and e2 . If k = 2, then
M = {e1 , e2 , (2a, 0)(4a, 0), (3a, 0)(3a, 1)}
is a set of independent edges containing e1 and e2 . Since the set of vertices of Γ [⟨a⟩ × {0, 1}] not in M can be partitioned
into even paths, M can be extended to a perfect matching M1 of Γ [⟨a⟩ × {0, 1}]. Furthermore, since the set of vertices of Γ
not in M1 can be decomposed into a finite number of copies of Γ [⟨a⟩ × {0, 1}], M1 can be extended to a perfect matching of
Γ.
Suppose that A = {±a} and ⟨a⟩ ̸= G. If C ⊆ ⟨a⟩, then there is no edge in Γ between the vertices of ⟨a⟩ × {0, 1} and of
H × {0, 1}, where H ̸= ⟨a⟩ is a coset of ⟨a⟩ in G. This contradicts that Γ is connected. Thus we may assume that C ̸⊆ ⟨a⟩. Let
b ∈ C \ ⟨a⟩. Then
M = {e1 , e2 , (a − b, 0)(2a − b, 0), (b, 1)(b + a, 1)} ∪ {(x, 0)(b + x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a, a − b, 2a − b}}
is the required perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 .
Suppose that A = {±a} and ⟨a⟩ = G. Let |a| = 2k + 1. If there is b ∈ C \ {0, a, 2a}, then
M = {e1 , e2 , (a − b, 0)(2a − b, 0), (b, 1)(b + a, 1)} ∪ {(x, 0)(b + x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a, a − b, 2a − b}}
is a perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 . So we may suppose that C ⊆ {0, a, 2a}. If C = {0}, then Γ ∼
=
C2k+1 × P2 ∼
= Z4k+2 (2, 4k, 2k + 1), a graph in class (iv) of Lemma 2.4, which is a contradiction. If C = {0, a}, then
Γ ∼
= Z4k+2 (1, 2, 4k, 4k + 1), a graph in class (ii) of Lemma 2.4, which is a contradiction again. If C = {0, 2a}, then
Γ ∼
= Z4k+2 (1, 4k + 1, 2k, 2k + 2), a graph in class (v) of Lemma 2.4, which is also a contradiction. If C = {0, a, 2a}, then
M = {e1 , e2 } ∪ {(x, 0)(x + a, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a}}
is the required perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 .
Lemma 3.5. Let Γ = SC (G; A, A, C ) be a connected semi-Cayley graph of an abelian group G and {e1 , e2 } a matching of Γ with
e1 , e2 ∈ E3 . If Γ is not isomorphic to any of the graphs listed in Lemma 2.4, then {e1 , e2 } can be extended to a perfect matching
of Γ .

Proof. Suppose that e1 and e2 have the same type. If e1 = (g1 , 0)(g1 + b, 1) and e2 = (g2 , 0)(g2 + b, 1) for some g1 , g2 ∈ G
and b ∈ C , then M = {(x, 0)(x + b, 1) | x ∈ G} is a perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 . If e1 = (g1 , 0)(g1 + b, 1)
and e2 = (g2 , 0)(g2 − b, 1) for some g1 , g2 ∈ G and −b, b ∈ C with b ̸= −b, then {0, −b, b} ⊆ C and so |C | ≥ 3. Therefore
{e1 , e2 } can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ by Lemma 2.5.
Suppose that e1 and e2 have different types. Without loss of generality, let e1 = (0, 0)(0, 1) and e2 = (c , 0)(c + b, 1)
with c ∈ G and 0 ̸= b ∈ C . If C \ {0, b} ̸= ∅, then, by Lemma 2.5, {e1 , e2 } can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ . So we
may assume that C = {0, b}. If ⟨b⟩ = G, then Γ is isomorphic to a circulant graph by Lemma 3.3. It follows from Lemma 2.4
and the hypothesis that Γ is 2-extendable. Thus we may assume that ⟨b⟩ ̸= G.
Let G0 = ⟨b⟩, |G0 | = k + 1. Then the 2(k + 1)-cycle

Γ0 = (0, 0)(b, 1)(b, 0)(2b, 1) · · · (kb, 1)(kb, 0)(0, 1)(0, 0)
is a Hamiltonian cycle of Γ [G0 × {0, 1}] containing e1 . Let G0 , G1 , . . . , Gm be the cosets of ⟨b⟩ in G and Gi = ai + G0 with
ai ∈ Gi for i = 1, . . . , m. Then the 2(k + 1)-cycle

Γi = (ai , 0)(ai + b, 1)(ai + b, 0)(ai + 2b, 1) · · · (ai + kb, 1)(ai + kb, 0)(ai , 1)(ai , 0)
is a Hamiltonian cycle of Γ [Gi × {0, 1}] for i = 1, 2, . . . , m. It is clear that e2 ∈ E (Γi ) for some i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m}. If i ̸= 0,
that is, e1 and e2 are in different even cycles, then Γ has a perfect matching containing e1 and e2 . So we may suppose that
i = 0; that is, e1 , e2 ∈ E (Γ [G0 × {0, 1}]).
We claim that A ̸⊆ ⟨b⟩. Otherwise, there is no edge in Γ between the vertices of Γ [⟨b⟩ × {0, 1}] and the vertices of
Γ [Gi × {0, 1}] for i ̸= 0. This contradicts that Γ is connected. Now, let a ∈ A \ ⟨b⟩. Then a ∈ Gi for some i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}. It
is clear that the subgraph Γ [(G0 ∪ Gi ) × {0, 1}] of Γ has a spanning subgraph isomorphic to C2(k+1) × P2 containing e1 and
e2 . Since C2(k+1) is 1-extendable, C2(k+1) × P2 is 2-extendable by Lemma 2.2. Thus there is a perfect matching M containing
e1 and e2 in Γ [(G0 ∪ Gi ) × {0, 1}]. Since the set of vertices of Γ not in M can be decomposed into even cycles, M can be
extended to a perfect matching of Γ .
Now we are ready to give the classification of connected 2-extendable semi-Cayley graphs SC (G; A, A, C ).
Theorem 3.6. Let Γ = SC (G; A, A, C ) be a connected semi-Cayley graph of an abelian group G. Then Γ is 2-extendable if and
only if it is not isomorphic to any of the following graphs:
(i) Z2n (1, 2n − 1), n ≥ 3;
(ii) Z2n (1, 2, 2n − 1, 2n − 2), n ≥ 3;
(iii) Z4n (1, 4n − 1, 2n), n ≥ 2;
(iv) Z4n+2 (2, 4n, 2n + 1), n ≥ 1; and
(v) Z4n+2 (1, 4n + 1, 2n, 2n + 2), n ≥ 1.
Proof. Necessity. It follows directly from Lemma 2.4.
Sufficiency. Suppose that Γ is not isomorphic to any of the graphs of classes (i)–(v). We shall prove that Γ is 2-extendable.
To this aim, let e1 and e2 be two independent edges in Γ . If e1 ∈ E1 and e2 ∈ E2 or e1 , e2 , ∈ E3 , then {e1 , e2 } can be extended
to a perfect matching of Γ by Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5.
If {e1 , e2 } ⊆ E1 or {e1 , e2 } ⊆ E2 , since Γ [G × {0}] ∼
= Γ [G × {1}], it suffices to consider the case {e1 , e2 } ⊆ E1 . Without
loss of generality, let e1 = (0, 0)(a, 0) for some a ∈ A and e2 = (c , 0)(d, 0) for some c , d ∈ G with d − c ∈ A. Then
M = {e1 , e2 , (0, 1)(a, 1), (c , 1)(d, 1)} ∪ {(x, 0)(x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a, c , d}}
is the required perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 .
If e1 ∈ E1 ∪ E2 and e2 ∈ E3 , by symmetry, we only need to consider the cases e1 ∈ E1 and e2 ∈ E3 . Without loss generality,
we may assume that e1 = (0, 0)(a, 0) ∈ E1 for some a ∈ A and e2 = (c , 0)(d, 1) ∈ E3 for some c , d ∈ G with d − c ∈ C .
Then
M = {e1 , (d − c , 1)(d − c + a, 1)} ∪ {(x, 0)(d − c + x, 1) | x ∈ G \ {0, a}}
is a perfect matching of Γ containing e1 and e2 .
Consequently, {e1 , e2 } can be extended to a perfect matching of Γ and Γ is 2-extendable.
In view of Lemma 2.4 and Theorem 3.6, the non-2-extendable semi-Cayley graphs of the form SC (G; A, A, C ) of abelian
groups are the only non-2-extendable Cayley graphs of abelian groups of even order. Moreover, the 1-extendability and 2extendability of Cayley graphs of non-abelian groups which can be realized as semi-Cayley graphs of the form SC (G, A, A, C )
of abelian groups can be deduced from Theorems 3.2 and 3.6.

4. Some applications
The connected 1-extendable and 2-extendable semi-Cayley graphs of the form SC (G; A, A, C ) of abelian groups have been
characterized in the previous section. As an application, in this section, we shall study the extendability of connected Cayley
graphs of two kinds of non-abelian group. We shall show that every connected Cayley graph of a generalized dicyclic group
is 2-extendable and give the classification of connected 2-extendable Cayley graphs of generalized dihedral groups.
Let H be an abelian group having a specific element y of order 2. A group G is called a generalized dicyclic group, written
as Dic (H , y), if it is generated by H and an additional element x, such that [G : H ] = 2, x2 = y, and for all h ∈ H, x−1 hx = h−1 .
Obviously, G = H ∪ Hx and 4 | |G|. Let G = Dic (H , y) and let G(S ) be a connected Cayley graph of G. Then G = ⟨S ⟩ and so
S ∩ {hx | h ∈ H } ̸= ∅. Take h0 x ∈ S. The next theorem shows that connected Cayley graphs of generalized dicyclic groups
can be realized as semi-Cayley graphs of abelian groups.
Lemma 4.1. Let G = Dic (H , y) be a generalized dicyclic group and G(S ) a connected Cayley graph of G. Then G(S ) ∼
=
SC (H ; H ∩ S , H ∩ S , C ), where C = {h ∈ H | h0 h−1 x ∈ S }.
Proof. Let Γ = SC (H ; H ∩ S , H ∩ S , C ). Define a map φ : G(S ) → Γ by φ(h) = (h, 0) and φ(hx) = (h−1 h0 , 1) for h ∈ H. It
is clear that φ is a bijection. To prove that φ is an isomorphism, let u, v ∈ V (G(S )). If u, v ∈ H, then v u−1 ∈ H, and
uv ∈ E (G(S )) ⇔ v u−1 ∈ S

⇔ v u− 1 ∈ H ∩ S
⇔ (u, 0)(v, 0) ∈ E (Γ )
⇔ φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Γ ).
1
If u = h1 x and v = h2 x for h1 , h2 ∈ H, then h1 h−
2 ∈ H, and
1
−1
uv ∈ E (G(S )) ⇔ h1 h−
∈S
2 = (h1 x)(h2 x)
1
⇔ h1 h−
2 ∈ H ∩S
1
⇔ h−
2 h1 ∈ H ∩ S
1
−1
⇔ (h−
1 h0 , 1)(h2 h0 , 1) ∈ E (Γ )
⇔ φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Γ ).

If u ∈ H and v = hx for h ∈ H, then
uv ∈ E (G(S )) ⇔ hux = (hx)u−1 ∈ S

⇔ h−1 h0 u−1 = (hu)−1 h0 ∈ C
⇔ (u, 0)(h−1 h0 , 1) ∈ E (Γ )
⇔ φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Γ ).
Therefore φ is an isomorphism.
Now we are ready to characterize the 2-extendability of Cayley graphs of generalized dicyclic groups.
Theorem 4.2. Let G = Dic (H , y) and let G(S ) be a connected Cayley graph of G. Then G(S ) is 2-extendable.
Proof. By Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 4.1, it suffices to show that the graphs listed in Theorem 3.6 cannot be realized as Cayley
graphs of generalized dicyclic groups. Since 4 | |V (G(S ))| for any generalized dicyclic group G and S ⊆ G with ⟨S ⟩ = G,
the graphs in the classes (iv) and (v) of Theorem 3.6 cannot be realized as connected Cayley graphs of generalized dicyclic
groups.
Suppose that Z2n (1, 2n − 1) ∼
= G(S ) for some n ≥ 3 and some generalized dicyclic group G = Dic (H , y). Then |S | = 2 and
|V (G(S ))| ≥ 6. Hence S = {hx, hyx} for some h ∈ H. It follows that G = {1, y, hx, hyx} and G(S ) ∼
= C4 . This contradicts the
fact that |V (G(S ))| ≥ 6. Therefore the graphs in the class (i) of Theorem 3.6 cannot be realized as connected Cayley graphs
of generalized dicyclic groups.
Suppose that Z4n (1, 4n − 1, 2n) ∼
= G(S ) for some n ≥ 2 and some generalized dicyclic group G = Dic (H , y). Then |S | = 3
and |V (G(S ))| ≥ 8. Hence S = {y1 , hx, hyx} for some y1 , h ∈ H with |y1 | = 2. It follows that
G = ⟨y1 , hx, hyx⟩ = ⟨y1 ⟩ ∪ ⟨y1 ⟩y ∪ ⟨y1 ⟩hx ∪ ⟨y1 ⟩hyx.
If y1 = y, then G(S ) ∼
= K4 (see Fig. 3(i)), a contradiction. If y1 ̸= y, then G(S ) ∼
= C4 × P2 (see Fig. 3(ii)), and so G(S ) is
2-extendable by Lemma 2.2. This is a contradiction. Consequently, the graphs in the class (iii) of Theorem 3.6 cannot be
realized as connected Cayley graphs of generalized dicyclic groups.
Suppose that Z2n (1, 2, 2n − 1, 2n − 2) ∼
= G(S ) for some n ≥ 3 and some generalized dicyclic groups G = Dic (H , y). Then
1
|S | = 4 and |V (G(S ))| ≥ 6. Hence S = {hx, hyx, h1 x, h1 yx} for some h, h1 ∈ H or S = {hx, hyx, h1 , h−
1 } for some h, h1 ∈ H

−1
for some h, h1 ∈ H, then, by Lemma 4.1, G(S ) ∼
= SC (H ; ∅, ∅, {1, y, hh−

1
∼
G(S ) = Z2n (1, 2, 2n−1, 2n−2) contains triangles, and so G(S ) is not bipartite. This is a contradiction. If S = {hx, hyx, h1 , h−
1 }

for some h, h1 ∈ H with h1 ̸= 1, then
1
G = ⟨hx, hyx, h1 , h−
1 ⟩ = ⟨h1 ⟩ ∪ ⟨h1 ⟩y ∪ ⟨h1 ⟩hx ∪ ⟨h1 ⟩hyx.

If y ̸∈ ⟨h1 ⟩, then hyx ̸∈ h⟨h1 ⟩x. Let |h1 | = k. Then G(S ) ∼
= Ck × C4 (see Fig. 4). Thus G(S ) is 2-extendable by Lemma 2.2.
This is a contradiction. If y ∈ ⟨h1 ⟩, then hyx ∈ h⟨h1 ⟩x. It follows that G = ⟨h1 ⟩ ∪ ⟨h1 ⟩hx and H = ⟨h1 ⟩. Since
1
−1
2
G(S ) ∼
= Z2n (1, 2, 2n − 1, 2n − 2), we must have hyx(hx)−1 ∈ {h1 , h−
1 }; that is, y = h1 or h1 . Hence h1 = 1. This is a
contradiction. If S = {h1 , h2 , hx, hyx} for some h, h1 , h2 ∈ H with h1 ̸= h2 and |h1 | = |h2 | = 2, then
G = ⟨h1 , h2 , hx, hyx⟩ = ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩ ∪ ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩y ∪ ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩hx ∪ ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩hyx.
If y ̸∈ ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩, then G(S ) ∼
= C4 × C4 (see Fig. 5(i)), and G(S ) is 2-extendable. This is impossible. If y ∈ ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩, then
G = ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩ ∪ ⟨h1 , h2 ⟩hx. Since G(S ) ∼
= Z2n (1, 2, 2n − 1, 2n − 2), we must have hyx(hx)−1 ∈ {h1 , h2 }; that is, y ∈ {h1 , h2 }.
∼
Thus G(S ) = K4 × P2 (see Fig. 5(ii)), and hence G(S ) is 2-extendable. This is a contradiction. Consequently, the graphs in the
class (ii) of Theorem 3.6 cannot be realized as semi-Cayley graphs of generalized dicyclic groups.
A 1-factor of a graph is a collection of edges such that each vertex is incident with exactly one edge. A 1-factorization of a
regular graph is a partition of the edge set of the graph into disjoint 1-factors. Stong [15] verified that every connected Cayley
graph Dn (S ) of a dihedral group Dn is 1-factorizable. His result implies that Dn (S ) is 1-extendable. Chen et al. [2] classified
the 2-extendable Cayley graphs of dihedral groups. Now, one can generalize these results to Cayley graphs of generalized
dihedral groups.

Let H be any abelian group. The generalized dihedral group of H, written Dih(H ), is the semidirect product of H and Z2 ,
with Z2 acting on H by inverting elements. Thus

(h1 , 0)(h2 , t ) = (h1 + h2 , t ),

(h1 , 1)(h2 , t ) = (h1 − h2 , 1 + t ),

where h1 , h2 ∈ H and t ∈ Z2 . If H is cyclic, then Dih(H ) is just a dihedral group.
Let G = Dih(H ) and let G(S ) be a connected Cayley graph of G. Then G = ⟨S ⟩, and so S ∩ {(h, 1) | h ∈ H } ̸= ∅.
Take (h0 , 1) ∈ S. The next theorem shows that connected Cayley graphs of generalized dihedral groups can be realized as
semi-Cayley graphs of abelian groups.
Lemma 4.3. Let G = Dih(H ) be a generalized dihedral group and G(S ) a connected Cayley graph of G. Then G(S ) ∼
=
SC (H ; A, A, C ), where A = {h | (h, 0) ∈ S } and C = {h0 − h | (h, 1) ∈ S }.
Proof. Let Γ = SC (H ; A, A, C ). Define a map φ : G(S ) → Γ by φ((h, 0)) = (h, 0) and φ((h, 1)) = (h0 − h, 1) for h ∈ H.
It is clear that φ is a bijection. To prove that φ is an isomorphism, let u, v ∈ V (G(S )). If u = (h1 , 0) and v = (h2 , 0) for
h1 , h2 ∈ H, then
uv ∈ E (G(S )) ⇔ (h2 − h1 , 0) ∈ S

⇔ h2 − h1 ∈ A
⇔ (h1 , 0)(h2 , 0) ∈ E (Γ )
⇔ φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Γ ).
If u = (h1 , 1) and v = (h2 , 1) for h1 , h2 ∈ H, then
uv ∈ E (G(S )) ⇔ (h2 − h1 , 0) ∈ S

⇔
⇔
⇔
⇔

(h1 − h2 , 0) ∈ S
h1 − h2 ∈ A
(h0 − h1 , 1)(h0 − h2 , 1) ∈ E (Γ )
φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Γ ).

If u = (h1 , 0) and v = (h2 , 1) for h1 , h2 ∈ H, then
uv ∈ E (G(S )) ⇔ (h1 + h2 , 1) ∈ S

⇔ h0 − h1 − h2 ∈ C
⇔ (h1 , 0)(h0 − h2 , 1) ∈ E (Γ )
⇔ φ(u)φ(v) ∈ E (Γ ).
Therefore φ is an isomorphism.
As direct consequences of our main results in Section 3, now the 1-extendability and 2-extendability of Cayley graphs of
generalized dihedral groups can be obtained.
Theorem 4.4. Every connected Cayley graph of generalized dihedral groups is 1-extendable.
Proof. The proof follows directly from Theorem 3.2 and Lemma 4.3.
The next theorem gives the classification of connected 2-extendable Cayley graphs of generalized dihedral groups.
Theorem 4.5. Let G = Dih(H ) and G(S ) a connected Cayley graph of G. Then G(S ) is 2-extendable if and only it is not isomorphic
to any of the following graphs.
(i) Z2n (1, 2n − 1), n ≥ 3;
(ii) Z2n (1, 2, 2n − 1, 2n − 2), n ≥ 3;
(iii) Z4n (1, 4n − 1, 2n), n ≥ 2;
(iv) Z4n+2 (2, 4n, 2n + 1), n ≥ 1; and
(v) Z4n+2 (1, 4n + 1, 2n, 2n + 2), n ≥ 1.
Proof. It is easy to verify that the graphs of the classes (i)–(v) can be realized as Cayley graphs of (generalized) dihedral
groups. Therefore the assertion follows directly from Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 4.3.
As a direct consequence of Theorems 4.4 and 4.5, we have the following.
Corollary 4.6. Let Dn (S ) be a connected Cayley graph of the dihedral group Dn . Then
(1) [15] Dn (S ) is 1-extendable;
(2) [2] Dn (S ) is 2-extendable if and only it is not isomorphic to any of the following graphs:
(i) Z2n (1, 2n − 1), n ≥ 3;
(ii) Z2n (1, 2, 2n − 1, 2n − 2), n ≥ 3;
(iii) Z4n (1, 4n − 1, 2n), n ≥ 2;
(iv) Z4n+2 (2, 4n, 2n + 1), n ≥ 1; and
(v) Z4n+2 (1, 4n + 1, 2n, 2n + 2), n ≥ 1.

1. Introduction
Let S be a finite set of points in the plane. We say that S is in general position if no three points of S are on a line. Denote
the convex hull of S by convS. We say that S is in convex position if each point of S is a vertex of convS.
We only deal with a finite set P of points in general position in the plane. If a subset of P with k elements is in convex
position, we simply call it a convex k-gon of P. A convex k-gon Q of P is said to be empty if no point of P lies inside convQ .
An empty convex k-gon of P is also called a k-hole of P.
Let P be a set of n points in general position in the plane. For any Q ⊆ P, we denote the area of convQ by A(Q ). In [5], we
considered the ratio between the maximum area of 3-holes (empty triangles) T of P and the whole area A(P ). Namely, let
F (P ) = max
T ⊂P

A(T )
A(P )

and define f (n) as the minimum value of F (P ) over all sets P with n points. Then we obtained the following result where c
is a constant:
Theorem A.

In this paper, we improve on the lower bound of f (n) to

(24+2 5)n+c

To achieve the aim we consider the existence of

5-holes of point sets. An ear of a point set is defined as a triangle with three consecutive vertices on the convex hull boundary.
That is, in the next section we show that any 9 point set contains a 5-hole if it has an empty ear. By using this result,
we prove that any 17 point set contains two 5-holes with disjoint interiors or one 6-hole, considered as a lemma for our
improvement.

2. The existence of 5-holes
We introduce the notations and definitions throughout the proofs.
2.1. Preliminaries
Let P be a planar point set in general position. We distinguish the vertices V (P ) on the boundary of convP from the
remaining interior points I (P ). Let R be a region in the plane. More generally, an element of P in the interior of R is an interior
point of R, and R is said to be empty if it contains no interior points. We represent a k-hole H by H = (v1 v2 · · · vk )k if
V (H ) = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vk } is in counter-clockwise order.
Denote the convex cone by γ (a; b, c ) with apex a, determined by a, b and c. If γ (a; b, c ) is not empty, we define an attack
point from the half-line ab to ac, denoted by α(a; b, c ) as the interior point of γ (a; b, c ) such that γ (a; b, α(a; b, c )) is empty.
For δ = b or c of γ (a; b, c ), let δ ′ be a point collinear with a and δ so that a lies on the line segment δδ ′ . Then we can use
γ (a; b′ , c ) and α(a; b′ , c ) and so forth. See Fig. 1. We also define a quasi-attack point 
α (a; b, c ) which is the point c or the
attack point α(a; b, c ), respectively if γ (a; b, c ) is empty or not. Let γR (a; b, c ) = γ (a; b, c ) ∩ R for a region R. αR (a; b, c )
denotes the interior point of γR (a; b, c ) such that γ (a; b, αR (a; b, c )) ∩ R is empty.
Let l(a, b) be the line passing through a and b. Denote the closed half-plane bounded with l(a, b), which contains c or does
not contain c by H (ab; c ) or H (ab; c ), respectively. Let S (ab; cd) be the closed region between l(a, b) and l(c , d), containing
{a, b, c , d} when the segments ab and cd do not intersect.
2.2. A 5-hole of 9 points
As noted in [1], Makai proved that any 9 point set contains a convex pentagon which is not necessarily empty. Harborth [4]
proved the following theorem by using Makai’s result.
Theorem B. Any set of 10 points in general position in the plane contains a 5-hole and the bound is tight.
We show that any 9 point set contains a 5-hole if it has an empty ear, which gives a sufficient condition for the existence
of a 5-hole of a 9 point set. In this subsection, for a planar point set P in general position, we denote V (P ) = {vi }i≥1 in
counter-clockwise order and I (P ) = {pi }i≥1 .
Proposition 1. (a) Any point set P with k = |V (P )| ≥ 6 and |I (P )| = 1 contains a 5-hole.
(b) Any point set P with k = |V (P )| ≥ 5 and |I (P )| = 2 contains a 5-hole.
(c) Any 8 point set P with |V (P )| = 5 and |I (P )| = 3 contains a 5-hole.
Proof. (a) If the interior point p1 lies inside the convex quadrilateral v1 v2 v3 v4 or not, we have a (k − 1)-hole of
(v1 p1 v4 v5 · · · vk )k−1 or a 5-hole of (v1 v2 v3 v4 p1 )5 , respectively.
(b) The line l(p1 , p2 ) separates the plane into two half-planes, one of which contains at least half of V (P ), denoted by V ′ .
We have a l-hole of V ′ ∪ I (P ) with l ≥ ⌈ 2k ⌉ + 2.
(c) l(p1 , p2 ) separates the plane into half-planes, one of which contains one or two vertices of P. In the case where
l(p1 , p2 ) intersects the edges v1 v2 and v5 v1 , if p3 lies inside the hexagon p1 v2 v3 v4 v5 p2 or not, we are done by (a) or we
have (p1 v2 v3 v4 v5 p2 )6 , respectively.
If l(p1 , p2 ) intersects v2 v3 and v5 v1 where p1 lies inside △p2 v2 v3 , then p3 lies inside the convex pentagon p1 v3 v4 v5 p2
since, otherwise, we have (p1 v3 v4 v5 p2 )5 . △p1 v3 v4 is empty since, if it contains p3 , we have (p1 p3 v4 v5 p2 )5 . Since △p2 v4 v5 is
empty by the same way, p3 lies inside △p1 v4 p2 . Then if p1 lies inside △v2 v3 v4 , we are done by (b) since the convex pentagon
v2 p1 v4 v5 v1 contains exactly two interior points of p2 and p3 . That is, p1 and p2 lie inside △v1 v2 v4 by the same way. If p3 lies
in γ (p1 ; p2 , v2′ ) ∩ γ (p2 ; p1 , v1′ ), we have (v1 v2 p1 p3 p2 )5 . Otherwise, we have (v2 v3 v4 p3 p1 )5 or (v1 p2 p3 v4 v5 )5 .
We obtain the next proposition by Proposition 1.

Fig. 2. v4 lies in H (v2 p2 ; v3 ).

Proposition 2. (a) If |V (P )| ≥ 5 for any 7 point set P, we have a 5-hole of P.
(b) If |V (P )| ≥ 5 for any 8 point set P, we have a 5-hole of P.
We now prove the following proposition.
Proposition 3. Any 9 point set P in general position in the plane contains a 5-hole, if it has an empty ear.
Proof. We are trivially done for |V (P )| = 9. If |V (P )| = 8 and 7, we are done by (a) and (b) in Proposition 1, respectively.
Assume that △v1 v2 v3 is an empty ear of P. For |V (P )| = 6, we apply Proposition 1(c) to P \ {v2 }. We have the remaining
two cases.
(I) |V (P )| = 5 and |I (P )| = 4.
For the 8 point set P ′ = P \ {v1 }, convP ′ is a k-gon with k ≥ 4 and it is a quadrilateral by Proposition 2(b), i.e., △v1 v2 v5 is
empty. Similarly, if we apply Proposition 2(b) to P \{vi } for i = 3, 4, 5, then all the ears of P are empty. Let p1 = α(v3 ; v1 , v5 ).
γ (p1 ; v3 , v1′ ) is empty since, if it is not empty, we have (p1 v1 v2 v3 α(p1 ; v3 , v1′ ))5 . Then if we apply Proposition 2(a) to 7 point
sets of P \{v1 , v2 } and P \{v2 , v3 }, γ (p1 ; v3′ , v5 ) and γ (p1 ; v1′ , v4 ) are empty, respectively. We obtain (v5 v1 v2 p1 α(p1 ; v5 , v2′ ))5
or (p1 v2 v3 v4 α(p1 ; v4 , v2′ ))5 .
(II) |V (P )| = 4 and |I (P )| = 5.
Let p1 = α(v3 ; v1 , v4 ). γ (v1 ; v3 , p1 ) is empty since, otherwise, we have (p1 v1 v2 v3 α(p1 ; v3 , v1′ ))5 . Consider p2 = α(v3 ;
p1 , v4 ). We suppose that p2 lies in H (v2 p1 ; v1 ) by symmetry since, otherwise, we adopt 
α (v1 ; p1 , p2 ) in H (v2 p1 ; v3 ). Then
γ (p2 ; v3′ , p′1 ) is empty since, otherwise, we obtain (v1 v2 p1 p2 α(p2 ; v3′ , p′1 ))5 . We have the subcases of (A) and (B).
(A) γ (p2 ; v3 , v1′ ) is not empty: For p3 = α(p2 ; v3 , v1′ ), p3 lies in H (v2 p1 ; v3 ) since, otherwise, we have (v1 v2 p1 p3 p2 )5 ,
and γ (p3 ; p′2 , p′1 ) is empty since, otherwise, we obtain (p3 p1 v2 v3 α(p3 ; p′2 , p′1 ))5 . γ (p2 ; p3 , v1′ ) and γ (p3 ; p2 , v3′ ) are empty
since, otherwise, we have (p2 v1 p1 p3 α(p2 ; p3 , v1′ ))5 or (p2 p1 v3 p3 α(p3 ; p2 , v3′ ))5 . We now obtain the symmetric configuration
according to P \ {v4 , p4 , p5 }. γ (p2 ; p′1 , v4 ) and γ (p3 ; v4 , p′1 ) are empty since conv(P \ {v1 , v2 }) and conv(P \ {v2 , v3 }) are
quadrilaterals by Proposition 2(a). For p4 = α(p3 ; v3′ , v4 ), if p5 lies in γ (p4 ; p3 , p′2 ), γ (p4 ; v4 , p′2 ) or γ (p4 ; v4 , p′3 ), we have
(p2 p1 p3 p5 p4 )5 , (v1 p2 p4 p5 v4 )5 or (v4 p5 p4 p3 v3 )5 , respectively.
(B) γ (p2 ; v3 , v1′ ) is empty: If v4 lies in H (v2 p2 ; v3 ), γ (p2 ; p′1 , v4 ) is empty since conv(P \ {v1 , v2 }) is a quadrilateral by
Proposition 2(a). For p3 = α(v3 ; p2 , v4 ), γ (p3 ; v3 , p′2 ) is empty since, otherwise, we have (p3 p2 p1 v3 α(p3 ; v3 , p′2 ))5 . Since we
have (v4 v1 p2 p3 α(p3 ; v4 , p′2 ))5 if γ (p3 ; v3′ , v4 ) is empty, we consider p4 = α(p3 ; v3′ , v4 ). Then S = S (v1 p4 ; p2 p3 ) is empty
since, otherwise, we have (p4 v1 p2 p3 αS (p4 ; p3 , v1′ ))5 . See Fig. 2 where shaded portions are empty. If p5 lies in γ (p4 ; v1′ , p′2 ),
we can apply Proposition 2(a) to P \ {v1 , v4 }, and if p5 lies in γ (p4 ; v4 , p′2 ) or γ (p4 ; v4 , p′3 ), we have (v4 v1 p2 p4 p5 )5 or
(v3 v4 p5 p4 p3 )5 , respectively.
If v4 lies in H (v2 p2 ; v1 ), we argue in the same way as above. γ (p2 ; p′1 , v4 ) is empty by Proposition 2(a), and γ (p2 ; v4 , v2′ )
is empty since, otherwise, we have (v4 v1 v2 p2 α(p2 ; v4 , v2′ ))5 . Then if we consider p3 = α(v3 ; p2 , v4 ) and p4 = α(p3 ; v3′ , v4 ),
we have a 5-hole of P for any possible position of p5 .
Fig. 3 is an 8 point set with an empty ear, containing no 5-hole.
2.3. Two 5-holes with disjoint interiors
Let P be an n point set in general position in the plane for n ≥ 3. A polar labelling of P is a labelling of the elements as
{p1 , p2 , . . . , pn } such that P lies on γ (p1 ; p2 , pn ) and pi is recursively defined as pi = α(p1 ; pi−1 , pn ) from i = 3 up to n − 1.
It is shown that any 18 point set P contains two 5-holes with disjoint interiors. In fact, since we have γ (p1 ; p2 , p10 ) and
γ (p1 ; p10 , p18 ) with disjoint interiors by a polar labelling of P as {p1 , p2 , . . . , p18 }, then each convex cone contains a 5-hole
by Theorem B.

Fig. 3. There is an 8 point set with an empty ear which contains no 5-hole.

Fig. 4. γ (
α2 ; p1 , p10 ) contains a 5-hole.

Proposition 4. Any 17 point set P in general position in the plane contains two 5-holes with disjoint interiors or one 6-hole.
Proof. Label P by a polar labelling as {p1 , p2 , . . . , p17 } with {p1 , p2 , p17 } in counter-clockwise order. By Theorem B, we have
5-holes of H1 and H2 in γ (p1 ; p2 , p10 ) and γ (p1 ; p9 , p17 ), respectively. Suppose that H1 and H2 have p10 and p9 , respectively
since, otherwise, their interiors are disjoint and we are done. Denote HU = H (p9 p10 ; p1 ) and HL = H (p9 p10 ; p1 ). We claim
that H1 lies either in HU or HL since, otherwise, H1 would contain p9 . By the same reason, H2 lies either in HU or HL . Then, if
H1 and H2 lie in HU and HL , respectively, or H1 and H2 lie in HL and HU , respectively, then H1 and H2 have disjoint interiors.
We now have the cases of (I) and (II).
(I) Both H1 and H2 lie in HU .
Neither γ (p9 ; p1 , p′10 ) nor γ (p10 ; p1 , p′9 ) is empty by the existence of H1 and H2 . Thus, H1 does not have p1 since, if it has
p1 and p10 , we have a 6-hole determined by V (H1 ) and α(p10 ; p1 , p′9 ). By the same way, H2 does not have p1 . Rotate the line
l(p1 , p9 ) in clockwise direction around p9 until it meets an element a1 of P. Then a1 lies in HL since, for a1 in HU , we have
H2 in γ (p9 ; a1 , p10 ) and a 5-hole in H (p9 a1 ; p1 ) with exactly 10 points of P. We have the point a2 in HL by the same reason
such that γ (p10 ; p1 , a′2 ) and γ (p10 ; p′1 , a2 ) are empty.
Assume that the point of intersection of l(a1 , a2 ) and l(p1 , p2 ) lies in HL by symmetry. S = S (p9 p10 ; a1 a2 ) is empty since,
otherwise, we have H1 and a 5-hole by {p9 , p10 , a1 , a2 , α} for α = αS (p9 ; a1 , p′10 ) or αS (p10 ; a2 , p′9 ). If △p1 a1 p9 is empty, we
have H2 and a 5-hole of the 9 point set {p1 , p2 , . . . , p9 } by Proposition 3. Thus, a1 ̸= p8 and p8 lies in HU . By the same reason,
p11 lies inside △p1 p10 a2 .
If γ (a1 ; a′2 , p′9 ) is empty, we consider 
α1 = 
α (p9 ; a′1 , p11 ). Since γ (p9 ; a1 , 
α1′ ) is empty, we have H2 and a 5-hole of the
exactly 9 points in γ (
α1 ; p1 , p9 ) by Proposition 3 with the empty ear △p1 p9
α1 . Suppose that γ (a1 ; a′2 , p′9 ) is not empty.
′

For a3 = α(a1 ; p9 , a2 ), if △p9 a3 a1 is empty, we have H2 and a 5-hole of {p1 , p2 , . . . , p9 }. Let a4 = α△ (a1 ; a3 , a′2 ) for
△ = △p9 a3 a1 . γ (a2 ; a′1 , p′10 ) is empty since, otherwise, we have H1 and (a2 a1 a4 a3 α(a2 ; p′10 , a′1 ))5 . Since γ (p10 ; a2 , 
α2′ ) is
empty for 
α2 = 
α (p10 ; a′2 , p8 ) as shown in Fig. 4, we also have H1 and a 5-hole in γ (
α2 ; p1 , p10 ) by Proposition 3.

Fig. 5. There is a 12 point set which contains neither two 5-holes with disjoint interiors nor one 6-hole.

(II) Both H1 and H2 lie in HL .
We can adopt the same a1 and a2 in HL as in (I). If △p1 a1 p9 is empty, we have H2 and a 5-hole in γ (p9 ; a1 , p1 ) by
Proposition 3. Thus, we assume that p8 lies inside △p1 a1 p9 , and p11 lies inside △p1 p10 a2 by the same way. If p8 and p11
lie in HU , we have H1 and (p1 p8 p9 p10 p11 )5 , and if they lie in HL , we have (p11 p10 p9 p8
α (p8 ; p′1 , a1 )
α (p11 ; p′1 , a2 ))6 .
By symmetry, suppose that p8 and p11 lie in HU and HL , respectively. γ (p9 ; p1 , p8 ) and γ (p9 ; p1 , p10 ) are empty since,
otherwise, we have H1 and a 5-hole by {p1 , p8 , p9 , p10 , α} for α = α(p8 ; p1 , p′9 ) or α(p10 ; p1 , p′9 ). Let SL = S ∩ H (p9 a1 ; p1 ) for
S = S (p9 p10 ; a1 a2 ). SL is empty since, otherwise, we have (p9 αSL (p9 ; a1 , p′10 )a1
α (p11 ; p′1 , a2 )p11 p10 )6 . Since γ (p9 ; p′10 , a1 )
is not empty by the existence of H1 , we consider a3 = α(a1 ; p′9 , a′2 ). Note that a3 may lie in HU . For the 8 point set
P ′ = {p2 , p3 , . . . , p9 }, convP ′ is a quadrilateral since, otherwise, we have H2 and a 5-hole of P ′ by Proposition 2(b), i.e., we
claim that V (P ′ ) = {p8 , p9 , a1 , a3 } where a3 = p2 .
In the case where a3 lies in γ (a1 ; p′9 , p′10 ), if γ (a1 ; a3 , p′10 ) is empty, H1 lies in γ (p10 ; p9 , a1 ) and we have a 5-hole in
γ (a1 ; a3 , p10 ) with exactly 10 points, and if it is not empty, we have (p11 p10 a1 α(a1 ; a3 , p′10 )a3
α (p11 ; p′1 , a2 ))6 . Suppose that
a3 lies in γ (a1 ; p′10 , a′2 ). Since we have a4 = α(a1 ; a3 , a′2 ) by the existence of H1 , we have (p11 p10 p9 a1
α (p11 ; p′1 , a2 ))5 and
′
′
′

′
(a2 a1 a4 a3 α(a2 ; p10 , a1 ))5 if γ (a2 ; p10 , a1 ) is not empty. If γ (a2 ; p10 , a1 ) is empty, we obtain H1 in γ (p10 ; p9 , a1 ) and a 5-hole
in γ (a1 ; p10 , a2 ) by Proposition 3.
We give a 12 point set in general position in Fig. 5 which contains neither two 5-holes with disjoint interiors nor one
6-hole.
3. The lower bound of f (n)
We now improve on the lower bound of f (n) in Theorem A. For point sets P in convex position with n elements, the value
f conv (n) is defined in a way similar to f (n). The following lemma is proved in [2].

Proof. Label P using a polar labelling as {p1 , p2 , . . . , pn } and consider the subsets Sk = P ∩ γ (p1 ; p2+15(k−1) , p17+15(k−1) )
−2
for k = 1, 2, . . . , ⌊ n15
⌋. Assume that A(P ) = 1 without loss of generality. Since each Sk contains two 5-holes with disjoint
interiors or one 6-hole by Proposition 4, we first suppose that each Sk has two√
5-holes with disjoint interiors. Let l(n) be a
−2
lower bound of of f (n) then. Denote these 2⌊ n15

by f conv (5) ≥ √1 in Lemma A.

The lower bound obtained when some subsets Sk of P have a 6-hole is larger than

Final remarks
Gerken [3] proves that any 1717 points in general position in the plane contains a 6-hole. The lower bound of f (n)
n −2
obtained by using this result is (2n − 5 − 47 ⌊ 1715
⌋)−1 which is much smaller thanl(n). We present an open problem. Find
configurations realising f (n) ≤

such that some constant c1 > 1.

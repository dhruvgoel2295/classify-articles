A graph G is diameter 2-critical if its diameter is two, and the deletion of any edge increases
the diameter. Murty and Simon conjectured that the number of edges in a diameter
2-critical graph of order n is at most n2 /4 and that the extremal graphs are complete
bipartite graphs with equal size partite sets. We use an association with total domination
to prove the conjecture for the graphs whose complements have diameter three.

1. Introduction
For notation and graph theory terminology, we in general follow [7]. Specifically, let G = (V , E ) be a graph with
vertex set V of order |V | = n and edge set E of size |E | = m, and let v be a vertex in V . The open neighborhood of v is
N (v) = {u ∈ V |uv ∈ E } and the closed neighborhood of v is N [v] = {v} ∪ N (v). For a set S ⊆ V , its open neighborhood is the
set N (S ) = ∪v∈S N (v) and its closed neighborhood is the set N [S ] = N (S ) ∪ S.
For two vertices u and v in a connected graph G, the distance dG (u, v) between u and v is the length of a shortest u–v path
in G. The maximum distance among all pairs of vertices of G is the diameter of G, which is denoted by diam(G). Distance and
diameter are fundamental concepts in graph theory and are well studied in the literature.
A total dominating set, denoted TDS, of G with no isolated vertex is a set S of vertices of G such that every vertex is
adjacent to a vertex in S, that is, N (S ) = V . Every graph without isolated vertices has a TDS, since S = V is such a set. The
total domination number γt (G) is the minimum cardinality of a TDS. A TDS of G of cardinality γt (G) is called a γt (G)-set. Total
domination in graphs was introduced by Cockayne et al. [3] and is now well studied in graph theory. For more details, the
reader is referred to the two domination books [7,8] and a recent survey on total domination [11].
1.1. The diameter 2-critical graph conjecture
A graph G is called diameter 2-critical if its diameter is 2, and the deletion of any edge increases the diameter. Plesník [14]
observed that all known minimal graphs of diameter 2 have no more than n2 /4 edges and that the extremal graphs are
balanced complete bipartite graphs. Murty and Simon (see [2]) independently made the following conjecture:
Conjecture 1. If G is a diameter 2-critical graph with order n and size m, then m ≤ n2 /4, with equality if and only if n is even
and G is the complete bipartite graph K n , n .

According to Füredi [5], Erdős said that this conjecture goes back to the work of Ore in the 1960s. Plesník [14] proved
that m < 3n(n − 1)/8. Caccetta and Häggkvist [2] showed m < .27n2 . Fan [4] proved the first part of the conjecture for
n ≤ 24 and for n = 26. For n ≥ 25, he obtained m < n2 /4 + (n2 − 16.2n + 56)/320 < .2532n2 . Then Xu [15] gave an
incorrect proof of the conjecture in 1984. Füredi [5] gave an asymptotic result proving the conjecture is true for large n, that
is, for n > n0 where n0 is a tower of 2’s of height about 1014 . The conjecture has been studied by several other authors, see
for example, [1,12,13] and elsewhere, but has yet to be settled.
1.2. Total domination edge critical graphs
A graph G is total domination edge critical if γt (G + e) < γt (G) for every edge e ∈ E (G) ̸= ∅. Further if γt (G) = k, then
we say that G is a kt -critical graph. Thus if G is kt -critical, then its total domination number is k and the addition of any edge
decreases the total domination number. The study of total domination edge critical graphs was initiated in [9]. It is shown
in [9] that the addition of an edge to a graph can change the total domination number by at most two. Total domination edge
critical graphs G with the property that γt (G) = k and γt (G + e) = k − 2 for every edge e ∈ E (G) are called kt -supercritical
graphs. Thus if G is kt -supercritical, then its total domination number is k and the addition of any edge decreases the total
domination number by two.
1.3. The relationship: diameter 2-critical and total domination critical
Hanson and Wang [6] were the first to observe the following key relationship between diameter 2-critical graphs and
total domination edge critical graphs.
Theorem 1 ([6]). A graph is diameter 2-critical if and only if its complement is 3t -critical or 4t -supercritical.
The 4t -supercritical graphs are characterized in [10].
Theorem 2 ([10]). A graph G is 4t -supercritical if and only if G is the disjoint union of two complete graphs.
As noted by Hanson and Wang [6], the complement of a 4t -supercritical graph is a complete bipartite graph. The number
of edges is minimized when the partite sets are equal in size, and so Conjecture 1 holds for this case and a subset of the
complements of 4t -supercritical graphs yields the extremal graphs of the conjecture. Therefore, by Theorems 1 and 2,
Conjecture 1 is equivalent to the following conjecture.
Conjecture 2. If G is a 3t -critical graph with order n and size m, then m > n(n − 2)/4.
1.4. Known results on the diameter of 3t -critical graphs
Bounds on the diameter of 3t -critical graphs were established in [9].
Theorem 3 ([9]). If G is a 3t -critical graph, then 2 ≤ diam(G) ≤ 3.
By Theorem 3, every 3t -critical graph has diameter two or three. Hanson and Wang [6] proved the following result.
Hanson–Wang Theorem. If G is a 3t -critical graph of diameter three and of order n and size m, then m ≥ n(n − 2)/4.
In order to prove that Conjecture 2 holds for 3t -critical graphs of diameter three, we need strict inequality in the
Hanson–Wang Theorem. Hence an additional edge is necessary to prove the conjecture in this case. We emphasize that
without strict inequality in the Hanson–Wang Theorem, the conjecture is not proven. While the Hanson–Wang Theorem
has a straightforward, short proof (only about a page), the difficult and challenging part is proving strictness in their bound.
Indeed a surprising amount of work is required to find this one additional edge.
2. Main results
Our aim in this paper is to prove that Conjecture 2 is true for 3t -critical graphs with diameter three. We shall prove the
following result, a proof of which is given in Section 3.
Theorem 4. If G is a 3t -critical graph of diameter three and of order n and size m, then m > n(n − 2)/4.
Thus using the important relationship between diameter 2-critical graphs and total domination edge critical graphs
stated in Theorem 1, Conjecture 1 is proven for the graphs whose complements have diameter 3.
2.1. Terminology and observations
We restrict our attention to 3t -critical graphs. We note that since γt (G) ≥ 2 for any graph G, the addition of an edge to a
3t -critical graph reduces the total domination number by exactly one. Hence if G is a 3t -critical graph, then γt (G) = 3 and
γt (G + e) = 2 for every edge e ∈ E (G) ̸= ∅. To aid us in the proofs that follow, we introduce some additional notation.

For a set S ⊆ V , the subgraph induced by S is denoted by G[S ], while the subgraph obtained from G by deleting vertices in
S (and all edge incident with S) is denoted by G − S. For a vertex v ∈ V , we let NS (v) = NG (v) ∩ S and we let dS (v) = |NS (v)|.
Thus, NS (v) is the set of neighbors of v that belong to the set S. We denote the degree of v in G by dG (v), or simply by d(v)
if the graph G is clear from context. Thus, NG (v) = NV (v) and dG (v) = dV (v). A vertex w ∈ V is an S-private neighbor of
v ∈ S if N [w] ∩ S = {v}, while the S-private neighbor set of v , denoted pn[v, S ], is the set of all S-private neighbors of v . An
S-external private neighbor of a vertex v ∈ S is a vertex u ∈ V \ S which is adjacent to v but to no other vertex of S. The set
of all S-external private neighbors of v ∈ S is called the S-external private neighbor set of v and is denoted epn(v, S ).
If X and Y are two subsets of V , then we denote the set of all edges of G that join a vertex of X and a vertex of Y by [X , Y ].
Further, if all edges are present between the vertices in X and the vertices in Y , we say that [X , Y ] is full, while if there are
no edges between the vertices in X and the vertices in Y , we say that [X , Y ] is empty. Let X \ Y denote the set of vertices in
X that do not belong to Y .
For sets S , X ⊆ V , if X ⊆ N [S ] (X ⊆ N (S ), respectively), we say that S dominates X , written S ≻ X (S totally dominates X ,
respectively, written S ≻t X ). If S = {s} or X = {x}, we also write s ≻ X , S ≻t x, etc. If S ≻ V (S ≻t V , respectively), we say
that S is a dominating set (total dominating set) of G, and we also write S ≻ G (S ≻t G, respectively).
Definition 5. Let G = (V , E ) be a 3t -critical graph, and let u and v be non-adjacent vertices in G. As γt (G + uv) = 2, there
exists an edge xy ∈ E (G + uv) such that in G + uv , {x, y} ≻ V . The edge xy may not be unique. However, we select one such
edge xy and call it the quasi-edge for uv , abbreviated q.e., and denote it by qeG (uv) = xy. (Thus with each edge in E (G), we
associate a unique quasi-edge.) If G is clear from the context, we will write qe(uv) instead of qeG (uv). Abusing notation we
will also denote V (qe(uv)) (= {x, y}) by qe(uv). Note that we always have |qe(uv) ∩ {u, v}| ≥ 1, as G is 3t -critical, implying
that qe(uv) is not a TDS of G. Thus either qe(uv) = {u, v} or |qeG (uv) ∩ {u, v}| = 1.
Definition 6. If e = uv is an edge of G such that exactly one vertex w is adjacent to neither u nor v , then we call w the
unique non-neighbor of u and v and we write un(e) = w .
We will frequently use the following observation and notation.
Observation 7. For any 3t -critical graph G and non-adjacent vertices u and v in G, either {u, v} dominates G or, without loss of
generality, {u, w} dominates G − v , but not v , for some w ∈ N (u). In this case, we write uw → v .
If S ⊆ V , and u and v are two non-adjacent vertices that belong to S, then we say that uv is a missing edge in S (rather than
‘‘uv is a missing edge in G[S ]’’). Also, if there are no missing edges in S, we take the liberty to write that S is complete (rather
than ‘‘G[S ] is complete’’). If uv is a missing edge that does not dominate V , then by Observation 7, uw → v or vw → u for
some vertex w ∈ V \ {u, v}. In particular, if uw is the q.e. for the missing edge uv , then un(uw) = v and uw → v .
To aid us in our counting arguments, it helps to pair a missing edge with a unique q.e. such that there is a one-to-one and
onto mapping from a set of missing edges to a set of quasi-edges. We call such a mapping a quasi-pairing. Let S be a set of
vertices such that there is a quasi-pairing of the missing edges of S. Then we say that S induces a quasi-clique. We note that a
quasi-edge has an endvertex outside of S, and a quasi-clique S contains both the existing edges of G[S ] and the quasi-edges
associated missing edges of G[S ]. Similarly, if there is a quasi-pairing for the set of missing edges between two sets A and B
of vertices, we say that [A, B] is quasi-full. We say that ab is an (A, B)-edge (respectively, missing (A, B)-edge) if a ∈ A, b ∈ B,
and ab is an edge (respectively, missing edge) in G.
The following observation and lemma will prove to be useful.
Observation 8. Let G = (V , E ) be a 3t -critical graph. If xy ∈ E is a q.e. for some missing edge in G, then xy is a q.e. for at most
two missing edges, namely xz and yz where z = un(xy).

Theorem 4. If G is a 3t -critical graph of diameter three of order n and size m, then m > n(n − 2)/4.
Proof of Theorem 4. For sake of contradiction, let G = (V , E ) be a counterexample to the theorem, and let G = (V , E ).
Amongst all vertices of eccentricity 3 in G, let u be one with minimum degree, and let A, B, C , be the sets of vertices at
distance 1, 2, and 3, respectively, from u. We proceed with a series of claims that we may assume the graph G satisfies.
Claim 1. C is complete.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that xy is a missing edge in C . Consider G + xy. Since {x, y} ̸≻ G, Observation 7 implies
that, without loss of generality, xz → y. But no neighbor of x dominates u, and so xz is not a dominating edge of G − y, a
contradiction. Hence, C is complete.
Claim 2. [B, C ] is quasi-full.
Proof. We need to show that for each missing (B, C )-edge, we can associate a unique quasi-edge. Suppose that x ∈ B, y ∈ C ,
and xy ∈ E. Consider G + xy. Since neither x nor y dominates u, by Observation 7, xz → y or yz → x. Further since no
neighbor of y dominates u, it follows that xz → y and z ∈ A to dominate u. Hence we associate the edge xz with the
missing edge xy. By Observation 8, we note that yz is the only other missing edge which can have xz as its q.e. However as
yz is a missing (A, C )-edge, we can uniquely associate the q.e. xz with the missing (B, C )-edge xy. We furthermore note that
un(xz ) = y ∈ C .
Claim 3. B is a quasi-clique.
Proof. To prove the claim, we show that for each missing edge of B, we can associate a unique quasi-edge. Let xy be a missing
edge in B, and consider G + xy. Then Observation 7 implies that, without loss of generality, xz → y and z ∈ A to dominate
u. We associate xz with the missing edge xy. We note that un(xz ) = y ∈ B, which implies that the q.e. xz is not associated
with a (B, C )-missing edge in Claim 2. By Observation 8 and the fact that yz is a missing (A, B)-edge we note that xz is not
associated with another B-missing edge.
Claim 4. A is a quasi-clique.
Proof. To prove the claim, we show that for each missing edge of A, we can associate a unique quasi-edge. Let xy be a missing
edge of A, and consider G + xy. Then it follows from Observation 7 that, without loss of generality, xz → y and z ∈ B to
dominate C . We associate xz with the missing edge xy. We note that un(xz ) = y ∈ A, which implies that the q.e. xz is not
associated with a (B, C )-missing edge in Claim 2 or a B-missing edge in Claim 3. By Observation 8 and the fact that yz is a
missing (A, B)-edge we note that xz is not associated with another A-missing edge.
By Claims 1–4, we have that K = A ∪{u} is 
a quasi-clique
and L = B ∪ C is a quasi-clique. Hence, letting |K | = k and

k
ℓ
|L| = ℓ, we have that n = k + ℓ and m ≥ 2 + 2 . If k ̸= ℓ, then by Corollary 10, m > n(n − 2)/4. Hence we may assume
that k = ℓ = n/2. In particular, we have that |A| = k − 1 = n/2 − 1. If some (A, B)-edge is not assigned as a quasi-edge
in the quasi-clique K or the quasi-clique L, then m > n(n − 2)/4. Hence we may assume that all (A, B)-edges have been
assigned as quasi-edges in the quasi-clique K or the quasi-clique L. Equivalently, we may assume that there exists exactly
one q.e. for each missing edge; otherwise, some (A, B)-edge is not assigned and the result holds. We proceed with a series
of claims that the graph G satisfies.
Claim 5. No vertex in B dominates A.
Proof. Suppose v ∈ B dominates A. Then all the n/2 − 1 (A, B)-edges incident to v have been counted as q.e. associated
with missing edges in B or missing (B, C )-edges. Thus, v has n/2 − 1 missing edges incident with it in B ∪ C , and so v is
non-adjacent with at least n/2 − 1 vertices in G[B ∪ C ]. However, |B ∪ C | = ℓ = n/2, implying that v is isolated in B ∪ C .
Now consider the graph G + uv . Since neither u nor v dominates C , by Observation 7, uw → v or vw → u. But no neighbor
of u and no neighbor of v dominates C , a contradiction.
Claim 6. If |C | ≥ 2, then [B, C ] is full.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that xy ∈ E where x ∈ B and y ∈ C , and consider the graph G + uy. Neither u nor y dominates
x, and so Observation 7 implies that uz → y or yz → u. If uz → y, then z ∈ A. But since |C | ≥ 2, {u, z } does not dominate
C \ {y}, a contradiction. Hence, yz → u. But then z ∈ B and z dominates A, contradicting Claim 5.
Claim 7. If |C | ≥ 2, then A is a clique.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that xy is a missing edge in A, and consider the graph G + xw , where w ∈ C . Neither x nor
w dominates y, and so Observation 7 implies w z → x or xz → w . But no neighbor of w dominates u, and so xz → w. Then,
z ∈ B to dominate C \ {w}. But since [B, C ] is full by Claim 6, we have that z is also adjacent to w , a contradiction.

1922

Claim 8. |C | = 1.
Proof. Suppose that |C | ≥ 2. Then, by Claim 1, C is complete. By Claim 6, [B, C ] is full. By Claim 7, A is a clique. If B is a
clique, then both K and L are cliques and therefore no (A, B)-edge is a quasi-edge. As G is connected, there is at least one
(A, B)-edge, implying that m > n(n − 2)/4. Hence we may assume that B is not a clique. Let xy be a missing edge in B, and
consider the graph G + ux. Neither u nor x dominates y, and so Observation 7 implies uz → x or xz → u. But no neighbor
of u dominates C , and so xz → u. Thus, z ∈ B ∪ C . By Claim 5, no vertex in B dominates A, and so z ∈ B and {x, z } dominates
A ∪ B ∪ C . Since {x, z } dominates A, there are at least n/2 − 1 (A, B)-edges from A to the set {x, z }. Since A is a clique and
[B, C ] is full, these edges have been counted as q.e. associated with missing edges in B. Let M be the set of missing edges in
B associated with the quasi-pairing of the (A, {x, z })-edges. Then, |M | ≥ n/2 − 1 and every edge in M is incident with x or
z in G. Since xz ∈ E and there are at most n/2 − 3 vertices in B \ {x, z }, at least two edges in M have a common neighbor w ,
say, in G. Thus, xw and w z are missing edges in B. But this contradicts the fact that {x, z } dominates B.
Let C = {v}. Recall that amongst all vertices of eccentricity 3 in G, u was chosen to be one with minimum degree.
Since the vertex v has eccentricity 3 in G, our choice of the vertex u implies that |A| = dG (u) ≤ dG (v) ≤ |B|. However,
|A| = |B| = n/2 − 1 implying that dG (v) = |B|. Thus, v dominates B.
Claim 9. If {u1 , u2 } ⊆ A, {v1 , v2 } ⊆ B, {u1 v1 , u2 v2 } ⊆ E and {u1 v2 , u2 v1 } ⊆ E, then {u1 u2 , v1 v2 } ⊆ E.
Proof. Let v1 v2 be a missing edge in B. Then there are two possible q.e.s for the missing edge v1 v2 , namely u1 v1 and u2 v2 ,
contradicting that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the missing edges and the quasi-edges. Hence, v1 v2 ∈ E.
Similarly, u1 u2 ∈ E.
Claim 10. If u1 u2 is a missing edge in A where dB (u1 ) ≥ dB (u2 ), then NB (u1 ) = NB (u2 ) ∪ {y}, where y is the end of the q.e.
qe(u1 u2 ) that belongs to B. Similarly, if v1 v2 is a missing edge in B where dA (v1 ) ≥ dA (v2 ), then NA (v1 ) = NA (v2 ) ∪ {y}, where
y is the end of the q.e. qe(v1 v2 ) that belongs to A.
Proof. Note that the q.e. qe(u1 u2 ) belongs to [A, B] and the end of this q.e. in B, namely y, is adjacent to exactly one of u1
and u2 . If there is a vertex in NB (u2 ) that is not in NB (u1 ), then since dB (u1 ) ≥ dB (u2 ), there is also a vertex in NB (u1 ) that is
not in NB (u2 ). But then by Claim 9, u1 u2 ∈ E, a contradiction. Hence, NB (u2 ) ⊆ NB (u1 ). However, y is adjacent to exactly one
of u1 and u2 , and so {y} ⊆ NB (u1 ) \ NB (u2 ). If |NB (u1 ) \ NB (u2 )| ≥ 2, then there are two possible q.e. for the missing edge
u1 u2 , a contradiction. Hence, NB (u1 ) = NB (u2 ) ∪ {y}. An identical argument holds with the set A replaced by the set B.
Claim 11. There exists a vertex w ∈ A such that dB (w) >
and w ̸≻ B.

|B| and w ̸≻ A or there exists a vertex w ∈ B such that dA (w) > 21 |A|

Proof. If both A and B are cliques, then the theorem holds. Hence we may assume that B is not a clique. Let v1 v2 be a missing
edge in B. By Claim 10, we may assume that dA (v1 ) = dA (v2 ) − 1. If dA (v2 ) > 12 |A|, then we are done by taking w = v2 .

Hence we may assume that dA (v2 ) ≤ 12 |A|, and so dA (v1 ) < 12 |A|.
We now consider the graph G + uv1 . Neither u nor v1 dominates v2 , and so Observation 7 implies uw → v1 or v1 w → u.
But no neighbor of u dominates v , and so v1 w → u. Thus, w ∈ B ∪ {v}. By Claim 5, no vertex in B dominates A, and so w ∈ B
and {v1 , w} ≻ A ∪ B ∪ C . Suppose that w ≻ B. Let {x} = NA (v2 ) \ NA (v1 ). Since {v1 , w} ≻ A, xw ∈ E. Let y = un(xw).
Since w ≻ B, it follows that y ∈ A. Thus, v1 y ∈ E. But then considering the set {x, y, v1 , w}, we have by Claim 9 that
xy ∈ E, a contradiction. Hence, w ̸≻ B. Since {v1 , w} ≻ A, dA (w) ≤ |A|/2 and dA (v1 ) < |A|/2 is impossible. Hence, w ∈ B,
dA (w) > 12 |A| and w ̸≻ B, which proves the claim.
By Claim 11, we may assume, without loss of generality, that there exists a vertex w ∈ B such that dA (w) > 12 |A| and
w ̸≻ B. Among all such vertices in B, we may assume that w is chosen so that dA (w) is a maximum. Let ww′ be a missing
edge in B. Then, dA (w) ≥ dA (w ′ ). By Claim 10, NA (w) = NA (w ′ ) ∪ {y′ }, where y′ is the end of the q.e. qe(ww ′ ) that belongs
to A.
Claim 12. For every (A, B)-edge e incident with w , we have un(e) ∈ B.
Proof. Let e = xw ∈ E, where x ∈ A. Let un(e) = y and assume, to the contrary, that y ∈ A. Since {x, w} ≻ B, we have that
xw ′ ∈ E. Since NA (w ′ ) ⊂ NA (w), we know that yw ′ ̸∈ E. But this implies that there are two possible q.e. for the missing edge
xy in A, a contradiction.
Let NA (w) = A1 = {u1 , u2 , . . . , up }. For i = 1, 2, . . . , p, let wi = un(ui w). By Claim 12, wi ∈ B for each i. Let
B1 = {wi |wi = un(ui w), 1 ≤ i ≤ p}.
Claim 13. wi ̸= wj for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that wi = wj for some i and j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p. Then there are two possible q.e. for the
missing edge wwi in A, namely the edges w ui and w uj , a contradiction.
By Claim 13, the unique non-neighbors of the q.e. that join w and A are unique. Let B1 = {w1 , w2 , . . . , wp }.

Claim 14. The set [A1 , B1 ] is full except for the missing edges u1 w1 , u2 w2 , . . . , up wp . Further, NA (w) = NA (wi ) ∪ {ui } for each
i = 1, 2, . . . , p.
Proof. Let i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p}. Then, ui wi ̸∈ E and wwi is a missing edge in B. Further, un(ui w) = wi . By our choice of the
vertex w , we have by Claim 10 that NA (w) = NA (wi ) ∪ {ui }.
Claim 15. p ≥ 3.
Proof. Assume that p ≤ 2 and note that |A|/2 < p ≤ 2, by Claim 11, which implies that |A| < 4. If p = 1, then |A| = 1.
But then |B| = 1, contradicting Claim 5. Hence, p = 2. If |A| ≤ 2, then Claims 11 and 5 contradict each other, so we may
assume that |A| = |B| = 3. By Claims 11 and 13, we have {u1 , u2 } ⊆ A and B = {w, w1 , w2 }. Let u3 be defined such that
A = {u1 , u2 , u3 }. Claim 14 yields that {u1 w2 , u2 w1 } ⊂ E and u1 w1 , u2 w2 ̸∈ E. By Claim 9, u1 u2 , w1 w2 ∈ E. By the definition
of w , we have w u1 , w u2 ∈ E and ww1 , ww2 ̸∈ E. As NA (w) = {u1 , u2 } and NA (w1 ) ⊂ NA (w) and NA (w2 ) ⊂ NA (w), it
follows that u3 w, u3 w1 , u3 w2 ̸∈ E. As the un(u1 w) = w1 , we have that u3 u1 ∈ E. Analogously, u3 u2 ∈ E. However this
implies that there are four edges in [A, B], but A is complete and G[B] contains exactly one edge. Therefore, G contains more
than n(n − 2)/4 edges, a contradiction to G being a counterexample.
Claim 16. For every (A1 , B1 )-edge, we have un(e) ∈ B.
Proof. For the sake of contradiction, assume that there exists an edge e = ui wj such that {x} = un(e) ∈ A. If x ∈ A1 , then
x = uj as all other vertices in A1 are adjacent to wj . However this is a contradiction to Claim 9, when considering the vertices
{ui , wi , uj , wj }. Therefore x ̸∈ A1 . By Claim 10, we note that NA (w) = NA (ws ) ∪ {us } for all s = 1, 2, . . . , p, which implies
that [x, B1 ] is empty. As p ≥ 3 by Claim 15, there exist two vertices wi1 , wi2 ∈ B1 such that {ui wi1 , ui wi2 } ⊆ E. However
both of these edges have x as their unique non-neighbor, and so xui has two possible q.e., a contradiction.
Claim 17. For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p, we have un(ui wj ) ∈ B \ (B1 ∪ {w}).
Proof. Let x = un(ui wj ) and note that by Claim 16, we have x ∈ B. If x ∈ B1 then x = wi as xui ̸∈ E. However if x = wi
then wi wj ̸∈ E and we obtain a contradiction to Claim 9, when considering the vertices {ui , wi , uj , wj }. Therefore x ̸∈ B1 . As
ui ∈ N (w) we note that x ̸= w , which implies that x ∈ B \ (B1 ∪ {w}), as desired.
Claim 18. If {e1 , e2 , e3 } ⊆ [A1 , B1 ], then un(e1 ) = un(e2 ) = un(e3 ) is impossible.
Proof. For the sake of contradiction assume that {x} = un(e1 ) = un(e2 ) = un(e3 ). Let ei = uti wsi for i = 1, 2, 3. If t1 = t2 ,
then x is non-adjacent to ut1 , ws1 , ws2 . By Claim 10, we note that NA (ws2 ) = NA (x) ∪ {ut1 } = NB (ws1 ), a contradiction as
us1 ∈ NB (ws2 ) \ NB (ws1 ). Therefore t1 ̸= t2 and analogously t1 ̸= t3 and t2 ̸= t3 . Note that ws1 has at most one non-neighbor
in {ut1 , ut2 , ut3 } (as it only has one non-neighbor in A1 ). Without loss of generality, assume that ws1 ut1 , ws1 ut2 ∈ E. However
this implies that we could have chosen either ws1 ut1 or ws1 ut2 as the q.e. of xws1 , a contradiction.
We now continue with our proof of Theorem 4. Note that there are p(p − 1) edges in [A1 , B1 ], and let U denote the
set of unique non-neighbors of these edges. By Claim 18, we get that |U | ≥ p(p − 1)/2 and by Claim 17 we note that
U ⊆ B \ (B1 ∪ {w}). As B \ (B1 ∪ {w}) = |B| − p − 1 and |A| = |B| and p > |A|/2, we get the following.

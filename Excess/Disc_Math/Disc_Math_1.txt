1. Introduction
Graphs in this paper are finite and may have multiple edges or loops. Terms and notation not defined here can be found
in [1]. Let G = (V , E ) be a graph on n vertices. For any v ∈ V (G), the set of neighbors of v in G is denoted by NG (v), or simply
N (v). Let N [v] = N (v) ∪ {v} and d(v) = |N (v)|. Denote by δ(G) the minimum degree of G. For two disjoint subgraphs A and
B of G, E (A, B) denotes the set of edges with one end-vertex in A and the other end-vertex in B and let e(A, B) = |E (A, B)|.
For any subset S of V (G), G − S denotes the graph obtained from G by deleting all the vertices of S together with all the edges
with at least one end in S. For two distinct vertices u, v of G, the distance of u and v , denoted by disG (u, v) is the length of
the shortest path between u and v . Thus, if uv ∈ E, then disG (u, v) = 1 and otherwise disG (u, v) ≥ 2. For any u ∈ V (G) and
for each 2 ≤ k < n, define
Nk (u) = {v|disG (v, u) = k, v ∈ V (G)}.
Given a subset S of V (G), disG (u, S ) = 2 means disG (u, v) ≥ 2 for any v ∈ S and there exists at least one v ∈ S such that
disG (u, v) = 2.
The complete graph on n vertices is denoted by Kn , and Kn− is obtained from Kn by deleting an edge. K3+,n−3 denotes the
simple graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph K3,n−3 by adding an edge between two vertices of degree n − 3.
The n-circuit, denoted by Cn , is a circuit on n vertices. The wheel Wk is the graph obtained from a k-circuit by adding a new
vertex and joining it to every vertex of the k-circuit. Wk is odd (even) if k is odd (even). For a technical reason, a single edge
is regarded as 1-circuit, and thus W1 is a triangle, called the trivial wheel. Let H be a connected subgraph of G. G/H denotes
the graph obtained from G by contracting all the edges of H and deleting all the resulting loops.
For an orientation D of G and a vertex v ∈ V (G), we use E + (v) (E − (v)) to denote the set of edges with tails (heads) at v .
Let A be an abelian group and A∗ = A − {0}. Define
F (D, A) = {f : E (D) → A}

and F ∗ (D, A) = {f : E (D) → A∗ }.

For each f ∈ F (D, A), the boundary of f is the function ∂ f : V (D) → A defined by

∂ f (v) =

−
e∈E + (v)

f (e) −

−

f (e)

e∈E − (v)

for each
∑ vertex v ∈ V (D). We say that G is A-connected ∗if G has an orientation D such that for every function b : V (G) → A
with
v∈V (G) b(v) = 0, there exists a function f ∈ F (D, A) with boundary ∂ f = b. An A-nowhere-zero-flow in G is a
function f ∈ F ∗ (D, A) such that ∂ f = 0.
Since the existence of a nowhere-zero mapping with a specified boundary depends only on the underlying undirected
graph and not on the orientation of the edges, we only talk about group connectivity of undirected graphs.
The concept of A-connectivity was introduced by Jaeger et al. [7] as a generalization of nowhere-zero flows. The following
two conjectures are well known.
Conjecture 1.1 (Tutte, Unsolved Problem 48 in [1]). Every 4-edge connected graph admits a nowhere-zero Z3 -flow.
Conjecture 1.2 (Jaeger et al. [7]). Every 5-edge connected graph is Z3 -connected.
A simple graph G of order n satisfies the Ore-condition [10] if d(x)+ d(y) ≥ n for each pair of non-adjacent vertices x and y.
Fan et al. [5] investigated the degree sum for nowhere-zero Z3 -flows. They also studied the Ore-condition for nowhere-zero
Z3 -flows [6]. Luo et al. [9] considered the Ore-condition and Z3 -connectivity. The results are listed as follows.
Theorem 1.3 (Fan et al. [5]). Let G be a 2-edge-connected simple graph on n vertices. If d(x) + d(y) ≥ n for each xy ∈ E, then
G has no nowhere-zero 3-flow if and only if G is K3+,n−3 or one of G4 , G5 , G7 , G11 and G12 in Fig. 1.
Theorem 1.4 (Fan et al. [5]). Let G be a simple graph on n vertices. If d(x)+ d(y) ≥ n + 2 for each xy ∈ E, then G is Z3 -connected
if and only if G is not K4 .
Theorem 1.5 (Fan et al. [6]). Let G be a simple graph on n vertices, n ≥ 3. If G satisfies the Ore-condition, then G has no nowherezero 3-flow if and only if G is one of G4 , G5 , G7 , G9 , G11 and G12 in Fig. 1.
Theorem 1.6 (Luo et al. [9]). A simple graph G satisfying the Ore-condition with at least 3 vertices is not Z3 - connected if and
only if G is one of the first 12 graphs in Fig. 1.
In this paper, we prove the following theorem.
Theorem 1.7. Let G be a simple connected graph with n ≥ 3 vertices. If d(u) + d(v) ≥ n for each pair of vertices u, v ∈ V (G)
with disG (u, v) = 2, then G is Z3 -connected if and only if G is none of the 15 graphs illustrated in Fig. 1.
If a graph G is Z3 -connected, then G admits a nowhere-zero Z3 -flow. The Ore-condition implies the degree condition in
Theorem 1.7, by checking the degree of each graph in Fig. 1, we see that Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 are corollaries of Theorem 1.7.
Furthermore, it is not difficult to check that each of G1 , G2 , G3 , G6 , G8 , G10 , G13 , G14 in Fig. 1 admits a nowhere-zero 3-flow,
and each of the remaining graphs in Fig. 1 has no nowhere-zero 3-flow.
Corollary 1.8. Suppose G is a simple connected graph of order n. If d(u) + d(v) ≥ n for each pair of vertices u, v ∈ V (G) with
disG (u, v) = 2, then G admits a nowhere-zero 3-flow if and only if G is none of {G4 , G5 , G7 , G9 , G11 , G12 , G15 } listed in Fig. 1.
Finally, the following corollary is considered as a partial result to Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2.
Corollary 1.9. Suppose G is a simple connected graph of order n with δ(G) ≥ 4. If d(u) + d(v) ≥ n for each pair of vertices
u, v ∈ V (G) with disG (u, v) = 2, then G is Z3 -connected, and so G admits a nowhere-zero Z3 -flow.
Recently, Zhang et al. considered degree sum condition for Z3 -connectivity in graphs. They proved if a 2-edge-connected
simple graph G satisfies d(x) + d(y) ≥ n for each xy ∈ E (G), then G is either Z3 -connected or one of some exceptional graphs
[11].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, former related results are presented and in Section 3, some
lemmas for proving the theorem are given. In Section 4, the main theorem is proved.
2. Known results
A graph G is triangularly connected if for every pair of edges e1 , e2 ∈ E, there exists a sequence of circuits C1 , C2 , . . . , Ck
such that e1 ∈ E (C1 ) and e2 ∈ E (Ck ), |E (Ci )| ≤ 3 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and such that E (Cj ) ∩ E (Cj+1 ) ̸= ∅ for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. Let H1

and H2 be two subgraphs of a graph G. We say that G is the 2-sum of H1 and H2 , denoted by H1 ⊕ H2 , if E (H1 ) ∪ E (H2 ) = E (G),
|V (H1 ) ∩ V (H2 )| = 2 and |E (H1 ) ∩ E (H2 )| = 1.
Lemma 2.1 (Lai [8]). Let A be an abelian group. If H is a subgraph of G and if both H and G/H are A-connected, then G is
A-connected.
Lemma 2.2 ([2–4,7,8]). Let A be an abelian group with |A| ≥ 3. The following results are known:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

Kn and Kn− are A-connected if n ≥ 5.
Cn is A-connected if and only if |A| ≥ n + 1.
Km,n is A-connected for m ≥ n ≥ 4 and Km,3 is not Z3 -connected.
Each even wheel is Z3 -connected and each odd wheel is not.
If G is not A-connected, then any spanning subgraph of G is not A-connected.

Lemma 2.3 (Fan et al. [4]). Let G be a triangularly connected graph. Then G is A-connected for all abelian group A with |A| ≥ 3
if and only if G ̸= H1 ⊕ H2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Hk , where Hi is an odd wheel (including a triangle) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
Lemma 2.4 (DeVos et al. [3]). Let G be a loopless triangularly connected graph with δ(G) ≥ 4, then G is Z3 -connected.
Let G = (V , E ) be a graph and let u, v, w be three vertices of G with uv, uw ∈ E. Define G[uv,uw] to be the graph
G ∪ {vw} \ {uv, uw}.
Lemma 2.5 (Chen et al. [2]). Let A be an abelian group. Let G = (V , E ) be a graph and let u, v, w be three vertices of G with
degree d(u) ≥ 4 and uv, uw ∈ E. If G[uv,uw] is A-connected, then so is G.
3. Lemmas
Let S be a subset of V (G). For simplicity, in the rest of paper, the subgraph induced by S is denoted by ⟨S ⟩. By Lemma 2.1
and (2) of Lemma 2.2, the following observation holds.
Observation 3.1. Let H be a subgraph of G. If H is Z3 -connected and for each v ∈ V (G) \ V (H ), e(v, H ) ≥ 2, then G is
Z3 -connected.
Lemma 3.2. No graph in Fig. 1 is Z3 -connected.
Proof. By Theorem 1.6, each of the first 12 graphs in Fig. 1 is not Z3 -connected. Each of the rest three graphs G13 ∼ G15 can
be written as G13 = W1 ⊕ W3 ⊕ W1 , G14 = W3 ⊕ W3 ⊕ W1 and G15 = W3 ⊕ W3 ⊕ W3 . By Lemma 2.3, the conclusion
follows.
Lemma 3.3 (Luo et al. [9]). Each graph in Fig. 2 is Z3 -connected.
Lemma 3.4. Let G be a simple connected graph on n ≥ 6 vertices and A be an abelian group with |A| ≥ 3. If d(u) + d(v) ≥ n
for each pair of vertices u, v with disG (u, v) = 2, then G is A-connected or G is one of G7 , G8 in Fig. 1, or G contains K4− as a
subgraph.

Fig. 2. Z3 -connected graphs.

Proof. We consider the following two cases according to the value of the minimum degree of G.
1
Case 1. δ(G) ≤ n−
.
2
Let x be a vertex with the minimum degree and N (x) = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xs }, where s = δ(G). Then the degree condition
of the lemma implies |N (x)| ≥ 2. Otherwise, N (x) = {x1 } and let y ̸= x be a neighbor of x1 . Since disG (x, y) = 2,
we have d(y) = n − 1. This contradicts xy ̸∈ E. If ⟨N (x)⟩ contains a path of length two, say x1 x2 x3 , then the subgraph
induced by {x, x1 , x2 , x3 } contains a K4− , we are done. So assume that all edges (if there exist) in ⟨N (x)⟩ are independent. Let
M = V (G) \ (N [x] ∪ N2 (x)).
Claim 1. Either G contains K4− as a subgraph or |N2 (x)| ≥ 2n − 1.
Proof. If there is no edge in ⟨N (x)⟩, then any pair of vertices in the subgraph has distance two and so d(x1 ) + d(x2 ) ≥ n.
This implies |N2 (x)| ≥ 2n − 1.
Suppose that there exists at least one edge in ⟨N (x)⟩, say x1 x2 ∈ E. If δ(G) = 2, then d(y) ≥ n − 2 for any y ∈ N2 (x),
which means y is adjacent to each vertex of V (G) \ {x}. Then K4− is a subgraph induced by {x, x1 , x2 , y}. Hence δ(G) ≥ 3.
Suppose there is another edge in ⟨N (x)⟩, say x3 x4 ∈ E. In this case d(x1 ) + d(x3 ) ≥ n and d(x2 ) + d(x4 ) ≥ n, say the former
holds. Since x1 x2 and x3 x4 are two independent edges of ⟨N (x)⟩, we have |N (x1 ) ∩ N (x2 )| ≥ n − (n − 2) = 2. Hence K4− is a
subgraph induced by x, x1 , x2 and a vertex in N (x1 ) ∩ N (x2 ) \ {x}.
Now we may assume that there is only one edge x1 x2 in ⟨N (x)⟩ and further assume N (x1 ) ∩ N (x2 ) = {x}. This implies
d(x1 ) + d(x2 ) ≤ n. Since disG (xi , x3 ) = 2 for each i = 1, 2, we have d(x1 ) + d(x2 ) + 2d(x3 ) ≥ 2n, and so d(x3 ) ≥ 2n . Thus
|N2 (x)| ≥ 2n − 1.
1
It follows by Claim 1 that |N (x) ∪ M | ≤ 2n . As d(y) ≥ n − δ(G) ≥ n+
for any y ∈ N2 (x), there is an edge y1 y2 in
2
⟨N2 (x)⟩. Therefore, |N (y1 ) ∩ N (y2 )| ≥ n + 1 − (n − 1) = 2. Let w1 , w2 ∈ N (y1 ) ∩ N (y2 ). Then K4− is a subgraph induced by
{y1 , y2 , w1 , w2 }.
Case 2. δ(G) ≥ 2n .
2

In this case, |E (G)| ≥ n4 . By the Turán’s Theorem, either G contains a triangle or G ∼
= Km,m , where m = 2n . If G ∼
= K3,3 ,
then it is G8 . If G ∼
= Km,m and m ≥ 4, then by Lemma 2.2, G is A-connected. Let G contains a triangle T = v1 v2 v3 v1 . For any
u ∈ S = V (G) \ V (T ), if u has two neighbors in T , then G contains a K4− . Otherwise, we have
3n
2

≤ d(v1 ) + d(v2 ) + d(v3 ) ≤ (n − 3) + 6 = n + 3.

This implies n = 6. We assume u1 , u2 , u3 ∈ S and E (T , S ) = {u1 v1 , u2 v2 , u3 v3 }. Since δ(G) = 3, dS (ui ) = 2 for each
i = 1, 2, 3. It is easy to see that in this case G is G7 . The lemma is proved.
Lemma 3.5. Let G be a simple connected graph on n ≥ 6 vertices with δ(G) ≥ 3. Suppose d(u) + d(v) ≥ n for each pair of
vertices u, v with disG (u, v) = 2. If there are at least two vertices of degree three in G, then either G is Z3 -connected or G is one
of G7 ∼ G15 in Fig. 1.
Proof. Let x and y be two vertices of degree three. If disG (x, y) = 2, then n = 6 and |N (x) ∩ N (y)| ≥ 2. First let N (y) = N (x)
and the neighbors of x and y be x1 , x2 , x3 . Let z be the remaining vertex of G. Then G must contain G8 as a spanning subgraph.
If G is not G8 or G9 , then there are at least two edges in ⟨N (x)⟩. it follows that G \ {x} contains a W4 . By Lemma 2.2 and
Observation 3.1, G is Z3 -connected.
So assume that N (x) ∩ N (y) = {x1 , x2 }, z1 ∈ N (x) \ N (y) and z2 ∈ N (y) \ N (x). Since δ(G) ≥ 3, either
z1 z2 ∈ E

and e(zi , {x1 , x2 }) ≥ 1

for each i = 1, 2,

(1)

z1 z2 ̸∈ E

and e(zi , {x1 , x2 }) = 2

for each i = 1, 2.

(2)

or

Suppose (1) holds. If e(xi , {z1 , z2 }) ≥ 1 for each i = 1, 2, G must contain a copy of G7 as its spanning subgraph. If G is not G7 ,
then G ⊇ G∗1 (in Fig. 2). By Lemma 3.3, G is Z3 -connected. So assume e(x1 , {z1 , z2 }) = 0. Since δ(G) ≥ 3, we have x1 x2 ∈ E
and e(x2 , {z1 , z2 }) = 2. So G is G12 . Hence (2) holds. Then G is G10 if x1 x2 ̸∈ E and G is G11 otherwise.
So disG (x, y) ̸= 2. We consider the following two cases xy ∈ E or disG (x, y) ≥ 3.
Case 1. xy ∈ E.
Let N (x) = {x1 , x2 , y} and N (y) = {y1 , y2 , x}. For simplicity, write N0 = {x, y}. We further let N1 = N (x) ∪ N (y) \ N0 ,
2
N2 = N2 (x) ∪ N2 (y) \ (N0 ∪ N1 ), and M = V (G) \ j=0 Nj .

Since disG (v, {x, y}) = 2 for any v ∈ N2 , we have d(v) ≥ n − 3. That is

v is adjacent to each vertex in V (G) \ {x, y} for any v ∈ N2 .

(3)

So the vertices in N2 together with any two vertices u, u ∈ N1 , induces G ∼
= Km or G′ ∼
= Km− . Furthermore, we have
′
′
e(z , G ) ≥ |N2 | for any vertex z ∈ M ∪ (N1 \ {u, u }). If |N2 | ≥ 3, then m ≥ 5. By (1) of Lemma 2.2, G′ is Z3 -connected. By
Observation 3.1, G′′ = ⟨V (G′ ) ∪ M ∪ (N1 \ {u, u′ })⟩ is Z3 -connected. Since e(x, G′′ ) = 2 and e(y, G′′ ) = 2, again by Lemma 2.2
and Observation 3.1, G = ⟨V (G′′ ) ∪ {x, y}⟩ is Z3 -connected. So assume |N2 | ≤ 2.
Case 1.1. M ̸= ∅.
Claim 1. If M ̸= ∅, then |N2 | ≥ 3 + |N1 | − e(u, N1 − u) − e(u, {x, y}) for any u ∈ N1 .
′

′

Proof. By (3), we have disG (u, z ) = 2 for any u ∈ N1 and any z ∈ M. By the degree condition and d(u) = e(u, N2 )+ e(u, N1 −
u) + e(u, {x, y}), we have
n − |N2 | − e(u, N1 − u) − e(u, {x, y}) ≤ d(z ) ≤ |N2 | + |M | − 1.
It follows by n − |M | = 2 + |N1 | + |N2 | that |N2 | ≥ 3 + |N1 | − e(u, N1 − u) − e(u, {x, y}).
Since e(u, N1 − u)+ e(u, {x, y}) ≤ |N1 |+ 1 for any u ∈ N1 , Claim 1 implies |N2 | ≥ 2. Recall that |N2 | ≤ 2, we have |N2 | = 2.
Suppose |N1 | ≥ 3. Then there exists u ∈ N1 such that e(u, {x, y}) = 1. By Claim 1, we have |N2 | ≥ 3, a contradiction. So
|N1 | = 2. Without loss of generality, assume N (x) = N (y) = {x1 , x2 }. Since |N2 | = 2, by Claim 1, we have x1 x2 ∈ E. It follows
that d(x1 ) = 5. By (3), disG (z , N1 ) = 2 for each z ∈ M. So d(z ) ≥ n − 5. This implies that ⟨M ⟩ contains a complete subgraph.
If |M | = 1, then G is G14 ; If |M | = 2, then G is G15 ; If |M | ≥ 3, then G′ = ⟨N2 ∪ M ⟩ is Km with m ≥ 5. By Lemma 2.2 and
Observation 3.1, G′′ = ⟨V (G′ ) ∪ N1 ⟩ is Z3 -connected, so is G.
Case 1.2. M = ∅.
In this case, V (G) = N2 ∪ N1 ∪ {x, y}. Since |N2 | ≤ 2 and |N1 | ≤ 4, we have 6 ≤ n ≤ 8. If |N1 | = 2, then |N2 | = 2. It is
easy to see that G is G11 or G10 . If |N1 | = 3, assume that x2 = y2 ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y), then disG (x1 , y) = disG (y1 , x) = 2. Since
d(x1 ) ≥ n − 3 and d(y1 ) ≥ n − 3, either x1 y1 ∈ E or there is a path x1 x2 y1 . If N1 induces a triangle, then W4 is a subgraph
induced by N1 ∪ {x, y}. It follows by Lemma 2.2 and Observation 3.1 that G is Z3 -connected. If N1 induces a path x1 x2 y1 and
|N2 | = 2, then ⟨N1 ∪ N2 ⟩ ∼
= K5− , and so G is Z3 -connected. If |N2 | = 1, then G is G12 in Fig. 1. If x1 y1 ∈ E and |N2 | = 2, then G
∗
contains G3 in Fig. 2 as a spanning subgraph. By Lemma 3.3, G is Z3 -connected. If x1 y1 ∈ E and |N2 | = 1, then G contains G7 in
Fig. 1 as a spanning subgraph. If it is not G7 , then G contains G∗1 as a spanning subgraph. So by Lemma 3.3, G is Z3 -connected.
If |N1 | = 4, then d(u) ≥ n − 3 for each u ∈ N1 , since disG (u, x) = 2 for u ̸∈ N (x), or disG (u, y) = 2 for u ̸∈ N (y). Therefore,
e(u, N1 ) ≥ n − 3 − 1 − |N2 | = 2. This implies that ⟨N1 ⟩ contains a spanning circuit. If N2 ̸= ∅, then ⟨N1 ∪ {v}⟩ ⊇ W4 , where
v ∈ N2 . Since e(u, G′ ) ≥ 2 for any u ∈ V (G) \ (N1 ∪ {v}), again by Lemma 2.2 and Observation 3.1, G is Z3 -connected. If
N2 = ∅, then G is one of G7 , G∗1 and G∗2 . By Lemma 3.3, the conclusion follows.
Case 2. disG (x, y) ≥ 3.
Let N (x) = {x1 , x2 , x3 }, N (y) = {y1 , y2 , y3 } and M = V (G) − (N (x) ∪ N2 (x) ∪ {x, y}). Since d(xi ) + d(z ) ≥ n for any
z ∈ N3 (x) with disG (z , xi ) = 2, and d(xi ) ≤ 1 + dN (x) (xi ) + |N2 (x)|, we have d(z ) ≥ n − 1 − dN (x) (xi ) − |N2 (x)|. It follows by
d(z ) ≤ n − 5 that the following claim holds:
Claim 2. |N2 (x)| ≥ 4 − dN (x) (xi ) for each xi with disG (xi , N3 (x)) = 2.
Case 2.1. N2 (x) ∩ N (y) = ∅.
By the degree condition, d(u) ≥ n − 3 for any u ∈ N2 (x). That is, u is adjacent to each of vertices in V (G) \ {x, y}. If
there exists xi such that dN (x) (xi ) = 2, then let G′ = ⟨N (x) ∪ N2 (x)⟩, and otherwise, let G′ = ⟨N2 (x) ∪ {x1 , x2 }⟩. So G′ ∼
= Km
or G′ ∼
= Km− . By Claim 2, m ≥ 5. Since for any vertex of u ∈ V (G) \ (V (G′ ) ∪ {x, y}), we have e(u, G′ ) ≥ |N2 | ≥ 2 and
d(x) = d(y) = 3, by Lemma 2.2 and recursively using Observation 3.1, G is Z3 -connected.
Case 2.2. |N2 (x) ∩ N (y)| ≥ 1.
If |N2 (x) \ N (y)| ≥ 2, then d(u) ≥ n − 3 for any u ∈ N2 (x) \ N (y), and e(v, N (x)) ≥ 2 for any v ∈ N2 (x) ∩ N (y). Let
G′ = ⟨(N2 (x) \ N (y)) ∪ {x1 , x2 , v}⟩, where v is any vertex of N2 (x) ∩ N (y) with v x1 , v x2 ∈ E. Therefore, G′ ∼
= Km or G′ ∼
= Km−
with m ≥ 5. By the similar argument as in Case 2.1, G is Z3 -connected. So assume |N2 (x) \ N (y)| ≤ 1.
Claim 3. disG (xi , y) = 2, and so d(xi ) = n − 3 for each i = 1, 2, 3.
Proof. Otherwise, as each vertex in N2 (x) ∩ N (y) has at most one nonadjacent vertex in V (G) \ {x}, we may assume
disG (x3 , y) ≥ 3. Then x3 yi ̸∈ E for each vertex yi ∈ N2 (x) ∩ N (y). If |N2 (x)| ≥ 3, then G′ = ⟨N2 (x) ∪ {x1 , x2 }⟩ is Km or
Km− with m ≥ 5. We may further check that e(u, G′ ) ≥ 2 for each u ∈ V (G) \ V (G′ ), by the similar argument above, G is
Z3 -connected. Therefore, |N2 (x)| ≤ 2. It follows from Claim 2 that dN (x) (xi ) = 2 for each i = 1, 2, 3 and |N2 (x)| = 2, and so
N (x) induces a triangle. It is easy to see that G′ = ⟨N (x) ∪ N2 (x)⟩ contains K5− as its spanning subgraph. Since e(u, G′ ) ≥ 2
for each u ∈ V (G) \ V (G′ ) ∪ {x, y}, and d(x) = d(y) = 3, we have that G is Z3 -connected.
By Claim 3, xi , i = 1, 2, 3, has at most one nonadjacent vertex in V (G) \ {y}. Therefore, M has at most one vertex. If M has
a vertex u, then N (x) induces a triangle. We claim that there is at most one edge absent in ⟨N2 (x)⟩. On the contrary, suppose
there are at least two edges absent in ⟨N2 (x)⟩. Recall that |N2 (x) \ N (y)| ≤ 1 and |N2 (x) ∩ N (y)| ≤ 3. There exists a vertex
v ∈ N2 (x) ∩ N (y) such that dN2 (x) (v) ≤ |N2 (x)| − 2. That is, v has at least three nonadjacent vertices in G (one is x, the other
two are in N2 (x)). This contradicts d(v) ≥ n − 3. It follows that G′ = ⟨N (x) ∪ N2 (x)⟩ is Km or Km− with m ≥ 5, and so G is
Z3 -connected.

Finally we consider the case M = ∅, which implies N2 (x) ⊇ N (y). Since d(xi ) ≥ n − 3 and d(yi ) ≥ n − 3 for each
i = 1, 2, 3, we see that ⟨N (x)⟩ and ⟨N (y)⟩ each contains a path of length two. If there exists u ∈ N (x) ∪ N (y), say u = x1
such that e(x1 , N (y)) = 3, then the subgraph induced by {x1 , y1 , y2 , y3 , y} contains a W4 , and so G is Z3 -connected. So
assume such a vertex does not exist. Hence N2 (x) = N (y). Again by the degree condition, N (x) and N (y) each induces a
triangle. Furthermore, we may assume that E (N (x), N (y)) = {y1 x1 , y1 x2 , y2 x1 , y2 x3 , y3 x2 , y3 x3 }. It is not difficult to check
that G∗ = ⟨N (x) ∪ N (y)⟩ is triangularly connected and δ(G∗ ) = 4. By Lemma 2.4, G∗ is Z3 -connected, so is G.
4. Proof of Theorem 1.7
Let G be a simple connected graph satisfying the condition of Theorem 1.7. By Lemma 3.2, it is suffices to prove that
except for the 15 graphs described in Fig. 1, G is Z3 -connected. We claim that δ(G) ≥ 2. Otherwise, let u be the vertex of
G which has only one neighbor, say v . Since G is connected, let w be another neighbor of v . Then disG (u, w) = 2, and so
d(w) ≥ n − 1. This means that w is adjacent to any vertices of G including u, a contradiction. Therefore, δ(G) ≥ 2.
Let δ(G) = 2 and N (u) = {u1 , u2 }. If n ≤ 4, then it is easy to see that G is one of G1 ∼ G4 . So assume n ≥ 5. Then
d(v) ≥ n−2 for any v ∈ N2 (u), that is v is adjacent to any vertex in V (G)\{u}. It follows that V (G) = {u}∪N (u)∪N2 (u)∪N3 (u).
We claim |N2 (u)| ≥ 2. Otherwise, let v be the only vertex of N2 (u). Since d(u1 ) ≤ 3 and disG (w, u1 ) = 2 for any w ∈ N3 (u),
we have d(w) ≥ n − 3. This contradicts e(u, {u, u1 , u2 }) = 0. If |N2 (u)| = 2, then d(w) ≥ n − 4 for any w ∈ N3 (u). Thus
G′ = ⟨N2 (u) ∪ N3 (u)⟩ is Km with m = |N2 (u) ∪ N3 (u)|. Then G is G5 or G6 if m = 2, and G is G13 (or G14 ) if m = 3(or m = 4).
Otherwise, G′ is Km with m ≥ 5. Since e(u, N (u) ∪ G′ ) = 2 and e(ui , G′ ) ≥ 2 for each i = 1, 2, by Lemma 2.2 and recursively
using Observation 3.1, we see that G is Z3 -connected. If |N2 (u)| ≥ 3, then G′ = ⟨N2 (u) ∪ N (u)⟩ is Km or Km− with m ≥ 5. As
e(x, G′ ) ≥ 2 for any x ∈ V (G) \ V (G′ ), by Lemma 2.2 and Observation 3.1, G is Z3 -connected. So δ(G) ≥ 3.
We prove the main theorem by induction on |V (G)|. If 4 ≤ n ≤ 5 and δ(G) = n − 1, then G is either G4 or K5 and by
Lemma 2.2, G is Z3 connected. If n = 5 and δ(G) = 3, let x be the vertex with N (x) = {x1 , x2 , x3 } and y be the remaining
vertex of G. Then δ(⟨N (x)⟩) ≥ 1, and so ⟨N (x)⟩ contains a path of length 2, say x1 x2 x3 . It follows by N (y) = N (x) that
G ∼
= W4 . By Lemma 2.2, G is Z3 -connected. Let n ≥ 6. Suppose that G is a simple graph with minimized vertices and the
theorem holds for G′ with |V (G′ )| < n. By Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5, we further assume that G contains a K4− , which is the
union of two triangles xyz and xyw with xy in common and d(z ) ≥ 4. Let G′ = G[zx,zy] . Then G′ contains a Z3 -connected
subgraph (2-circuit xyx). Let H be the maximal, Z3 -connected, connected subgraph of G′ and G∗ = G′ /H. Denote by u∗
the new vertex into which H is contracted. Then G∗ is a connected graph. Suppose otherwise that G∗ is not connected. It
follows that z is a cut vertex and {zx, zy} is an edge cut. Let G1 and G2 be two subgraphs of G such that G = G1 ∪ G2 and
V (G1 ) ∩ V (G2 ) = {z } and x, y ∈ V (G2 ). Since d(z ) ≥ 4, there is a vertex z1 ∈ V (G1 ) such that z1 ∈ N (z ). Then d(z1 , y) = 2.
By the degree condition, d(z1 ) + d(y) ≥ n. On the other hand, d(z1 ) ≤ |V (G1 )| − 1 and d(y) ≤ |V (G2 )| − 1, which implies
that d(z1 ) + d(y) ≤ |V (G1 )| + |V (G2 )| − 2 = n − 1. This contradiction proves that G∗ is connected. Let S = G − V (H ). We
have the following observations.
dG∗ (u) = d(u) for any u ∈ V (G∗ ) \ {u∗ , z }, dG∗ (z ) = d(z ) − 2,
d G∗

(4)

(u ) ≥ d(t ) − (|V (H )| − 1) + e(H − t , S ) for any t ∈ V (H ),
∗

(5)

and
e(v, H ) ≤ 1

for any v ∈ V (G) \ V (H ).

(6)

Since {x, y, w} ⊆ V (H ), we have n = |V (G )| ≤ n − 2. We are going to show that dG∗ (u) + dG∗ (v) ≥ n for any pair of
vertices u, v of G∗ with disG∗ (u, v) = 2.
Let u, v be any pair of vertices of G∗ with disG∗ (u, v) = 2. If {u, v} = {u∗ , z }, then assume u = u∗ and v = z; if
|{u, v} ∩ {u∗ , z }| = 1, then assume u = u∗ or v = z. The following two cases occur.
Case 1. u ̸= u∗ .
If disG (u, v) = 2, then by (4), we have that dG∗ (u)+ dG∗ (v) ≥ d(u)+ d(v)− 2 ≥ n − 2 ≥ n∗ . So disG (u, v) ≥ 3 and suppose
dG∗ (u) + dG∗ (v) ≤ n∗ − 1. Let u′ , v ′ be the vertices in H such that disG (u, u′ ) = 2 and disG (v, v ′ ) = 2. We claim that we may
choose u′ , v ′ such that u′ ̸= v ′ . On the contrary, u′ = v ′ . Let u′′ ∈ V (H ) and v ′′ ∈ V (H ) be the common neighbors of u, u′
and v, v ′ , respectively. Since disG (u′′ , v ′′ ) = 2, we have |N (u′′ ) ∩ N (v ′′ )| ≥ n − (n − 2) = 2. By (6), N (u′′ ) ∩ N (v ′′ ) ⊆ V (H ).
Let {u′ , v ′ } ⊆ N (u′′ ) ∩ N (v ′′ ) with u′ ̸= v ′ , we are done.
Since disG (u, u′ ) = 2 and disG (v, v ′ ) = 2, d(u) + d(u′ ) + d(v) + d(v ′ ) ≥ 2n. By (4), we have d(u′ ) + d(v ′ ) ≥
2n − (dG∗ (u) + dG∗ (v) + 2) ≥ n + (n − n∗ − 1). Hence |N (u′ ) ∩ N (v ′ )| ≥ n − n∗ − 1. It follows by (6) and |V (H )| = n − n∗ + 1
that V (H ) = N [u′ ] ∩ N [v ′ ] and N (u′ ) ∪ N (v ′ ) = V (G). So uv ′ , u′ v ∈ E and disG (t , u) = 2, disG (t , v) = 2 for each
vertex t ∈ V (H ) \ {u′ , v ′ }. Let t1 , t2 be any two distinct vertices in V (H ). Similarly, d(t1 ) + d(t2 ) ≥ n + (n − n∗ − 1),
V (H ) = N [t1 ] ∩ N [t2 ] and N (t1 ) ∪ N (t2 ) = V (G). Since |V (H )| ≥ 3, by the pigeonhole principle, each vertex in S has at least
two neighbors in V (H ), this contradicts (6).
Case 2. u = u∗ .
In this case, there must exist t ∈ V (H ) such that disG (t , v) = 2, and so d(t ) + d(v) ≥ n. By (4) and (5), the following
inequality holds
∗

∗

dG∗ (u∗ ) + dG∗ (z ) ≥ d(t ) + d(z ) − 2 − (|V (H )| − 1) + e(H − t , S ) ≥ n∗ − 2 + e(H − t , S ).

If e(H − t , S ) ≥ 2, we are done. So assume that
e(H − t , S ) ≤ 1.

(7)

By the definition of H, any vertex of H must have at least two neighbors in H. Let {t1 , t2 } ⊆ N (t ) ∩ V (H ). Then disG (a, t1 ) =
disG (a, t2 ) = 2, where a is the common neighbor of t and v . By (7), we assume e(t1 , S ) = 0. So n ≤ d(a) + d(t1 ) ≤
|S | + |V (H )| − 1 = n − 1, a contradiction.
We have shown that dG∗ (u) + dG∗ (v) ≥ n∗ for any pair of vertices u, v of G∗ with disG∗ (u, v) = 2. By the induction
hypothesis, either G∗ is Z3 -connected or G∗ is one of the 15 graphs in Fig. 1. If the former holds, we are done. So the latter
holds. Since G∗ has at most two vertices of degree two, G∗ cannot be G1 , G2 . If G∗ is G3 , then the two vertices of degree two
must be z and u∗ , and so G has at least two vertices of degree three. By Lemma 3.5, G is either Z3 -connected or one of G7 ∼ G15
in Fig. 1. For G4 , G5 , G7 ∼ G12 , and G15 , they all contain at least four vertices of degree three which means G contains at least
two vertices of degree three. By Lemma 3.5 again, G is either Z3 -connected or one of G7 ∼ G15 . Since G6 comes from G5 by
adding one edge, if G∗ is G6 , then we are done. If G∗ is G13 , then the two vertices of degree two must be z , u∗ , for any vertex
u with disG (u, z ) = 2, we have n ≤ d(u) + d(z ) = 8, and so n = 8. Therefore, V (H ) = {x, y, w}. It follows by δ(G) ≥ 3 that
e(w, S ) ≥ 1. If e(w, S ) = 2, then x, y are two vertices of degree three, and so G is Z3 -connected. So e(w, S ) = 1 and assume
e(x, S ) = 0. In this case, x, w are two vertices of degree three, we are done. Finally, if G∗ is G14 , then the vertex of degree two
must be one of z , u∗ , say z (the case dG∗ (u∗ ) = 2 is similar). If u∗ is a vertex of degree four, then we are done. So assume that
the vertex of degree three must be u∗ and let v be the other vertex of degree three. For any u with disG (u, v) = 2, we have
n ≤ d(u) + d(v) = 7. Hence n = 7, this contradicts 7 = n∗ ≤ n − 2, and thus proves the theorem.

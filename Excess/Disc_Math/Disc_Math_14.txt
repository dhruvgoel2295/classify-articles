For two graphs, G and H, an edge coloring of a complete graph is (G, H )-good if there is
no monochromatic subgraph isomorphic to G and no rainbow subgraph isomorphic to H
in this coloring. The set of numbers of colors used by (G, H )-good colorings of Kn is called
a mixed Ramsey spectrum. This note addresses a fundamental question of whether the
spectrum is an interval. It is shown that the answer is ‘‘yes’’ if G is not a star and H does not
contain a pendant edge.

1. Introduction
Let G and H be two graphs on fixed numbers of vertices. An edge coloring of a complete graph Kn is called (G, H )-good
if there is no monochromatic copy of G and no rainbow (totally multicolored) copy of H in this coloring. This, sometimes
called mixed Ramsey coloring, is a hybrid of classical Ramsey [12] and anti-Ramsey [4] colorings. As shown by Jamison and
West [10], a (G, H )-good coloring of an arbitrarily large complete graph exists unless G is a star or H is a forest.
Let S (n; G, H ) be the set of the numbers k, such that there is a (G, H )-good k-coloring of Kn . Here, a k-coloring is a coloring
using exactly k colors. We call S (n; G, H ) a spectrum. Let max S (n; G, H ) and min S (n; G, H ) be the maximum number and
minimum number in S (n; G, H ), respectively. The behaviors of these functions have been studied by [2,6,1] among others.
Note that, if there were no restrictions
ongraphs G or H, then the spectrum would be an interval. For a graph G on at least

n + 1 vertices, S (n; G, H ) = 1, AR(n, H ) , where AR(n, H ) is the classical anti-Ramsey number; for a graph H on at least
n + 1 vertices, S (n; G, H ) = k, 2 , where k = k(n, G) is the largest number such that n ≥ rk−1 (G), the classical multicolor
Ramsey number.
The main question investigated in this note is whether the same behavior continues to hold for mixed Ramsey colorings.
Specifically, for a given integer n, and for graphs G and H, is S (n; G, H ) an interval? When G is not a star, for most graphs H,
we show that S (n; G, H ) is an interval.

Theorem 1. Let G be a graph that is not a star, and let H be a graph with minimum degree at least 2. Then, for any natural number
n, S (n; G, H ) is an interval.
The simplest connected graph H that is not a tree and that has a vertex of degree 1 is K3 + e, a 4-vertex graph obtained
by attaching a pendant edge to a triangle. We show that S (n; G, K3 + e) could have a gap for some graphs G and some values
of n. However, when n is arbitrarily large, we do not have a single example of a graph G and a graph H for which S (n; G, H )
is not an interval.

Corollary 3. If ℓ ≥ 2 and n ≥ max{17, 3ℓ + 1}, then S (n; G, K3 + e) is an interval for any G ∈ {ℓK2 , K3 , P4 , C4 , K1,ℓ }. However,
S (n; G, K3 + e) is not an interval if n = 10 and G = C4 .
Open question. Are there graphs G and H such that for any natural number N there is n > N so that S (n; G, H ) is not an
interval?
2. Definitions and proofs of main results
For an edge coloring c of Kn and a vertex x ∈ V (Kn ), let Nc (x) be the set of colors used only on edges incident to x, and for
X ⊆ V (Kn ) let c (X ) be the set of colors used on edges induced by X . Let |c | denote the number of colors used in the coloring
c. Then |c | = |Nc (x)| + |c (V (Kn ) − x)| for any x ∈ V (Kn ).
Observation 1. If G is not a star, and A and B are color classes that are stars with the same center in a (G, H )-good k-coloring
c of Kn , then replacing A and B in c with a new color class A ∪ B gives a (G, H )-good (k − 1)-coloring.
Observation 2. For any graphs G and H,
min S (n; G, H ) ≤ min S (n + 1; G, H ).
Proof. Consider a (G, H )-good coloring of Kn+1 with k colors. Delete one vertex to get a (G, H )-good coloring of Kn with
k′ ≤ k colors.
Observation 3. For G ⊆ G′ and H ⊆ H ′ ,
S (n; G, H ) ⊆ S (n; G′ , H ) ⊆ S (n; G′ , H ′ ),

and S (n; G, H ) ⊆ S (n; G, H ′ ) ⊆ S (n; G′ , H ′ ).

Proof. If there is no monochromatic G and no rainbow H in a coloring of E (Kn ), then there is no monochromatic G′ and no
rainbow H ′ in this coloring.
Observation 4. If G is not a star, H has minimum degree at least 2, and k ∈ S (n; G, H ), then k + 1 ∈ S (n + 1; G, H ).
Proof. Consider a (G, H )-good k-coloring of Kn . Add a new vertex x, and color edges incident to x by a new color to get a
(G, H )-good (k + 1)-coloring of Kn+1 .
Proof of Theorem 1. We prove that [min S (n; G, H ), max S (n; G, H )] ⊆ S (n; G, H ) using induction on n. When n = 2, every
coloring uses one color.
Let n ≥ 3. Consider the smallest k such that [k, max S (n; G, H )] ⊆ S (n; G, H ). First, note that, for any (G, H )-good
k-coloring c of Kn and any vertex x, we have |Nc (x)| ≤ 1; otherwise, by applying Observation 1, we obtain a (G, H )-good
(k − 1)-coloring of Kn , which contradicts the minimality of k. Consider a (G, H )-good k-coloring of Kn and any vertex x, and
delete it. We now have a (G, H )-good coloring of Kn−1 with k or k − 1 colors. Here, we note that max S (n − 1; G, H ) ≥ k − 1.
By induction hypothesis, S (n − 1; G, H ) is an interval, i.e. [min S (n − 1; G, H ), max S (n − 1; G, H )] = S (n − 1; G, H ). Then,
by Observation 4, [min S (n − 1; G, H ) + 1, max S (n − 1; G, H ) + 1] ⊆ S (n; G, H ). Since min S (n; G, H ) ≥ min S (n − 1; G, H )
from Observation 2, [min S (n; G, H ), max S (n − 1; G, H ) + 1] ⊆ S (n; G, H ). Since k ≤ max S (n − 1; G, H ) + 1 and
[k, max S (n; G, H )] ⊆ S (n; G, H ), we finally have that [min S (n; G, H ), max S (n; G, H )] ⊆ S (n; G, H ).
For the proof of Theorem 2, we shall use the function
f (k; G, H ) := max{n : there is a (G, H )-good coloring of Kn using exactly k colors}.
Note that, if f (k; G, H ) = n, then min S (n; G, H ) ≤ k.
Observation 5. If f (k; G, H ) = n and f (k˜ ; G, H ) < n for any k˜ < k, then min S (n; G, H ) = k. In particular, if f is strictly
increasing in k, then f (k; G, H ) = n implies that min S (n; G, H ) = k.

Proof of Theorem 2. First, observe that max S (n; G, H ) ≤ AR(n, H ), where AR(n, H ) is the classical anti-Ramsey number,
the maximum number of colors in an edge coloring of Kn with no rainbow subgraphs isomorphic to H. If G is not a star,
then max S (n; G, K3 ) = AR(n, K3 ) = n − 1; see [2]. Moreover, from Observation 3, we obtain that max S (n; G, K3 ) ≤
max S (n; G, K3 + e); and from [7], we know that AR(n, K3 ) = AR(n, K3 + e) for n ≥ 4. Thus, when G is not a star,
max S (n; G, K3 ) = max S (n; G, K3 + e) = n − 1 for n ≥ 4.
Therefore, for n ≥ 4, if min S (n; G, K3 ) = min S (n, G, K3 +e) and G is not a star, then we can conclude that S (n; G, K3 +e) =
S (n; G, K3 ), which is an interval by Theorem 1. Next, we shall analyze min S (n, G, K3 + e). We note that f (k; G, H )+ 1 ≤ rk (G),
where rk (G) denotes the classical k-color Ramsey number for G. The equality holds if there is a k-coloring of E (Krk (G)−1 ) with
no monochromatic G and no rainbow H.
Case 1. G = ℓK2
From [11], we have that rk (ℓK2 ) = (k − 1)(ℓ − 1) + 2ℓ. The extremal coloring providing this Ramsey number can be
constructed as follows. Starting with a complete graph on 2ℓ − 1 vertices, whose edges are colored entirely with color
1, add ℓ − 1 vertices and color all edges incident to these vertices with color 2. Then add another ℓ − 1 vertices and
color all edges incident to these vertices with color 3. Repeat this process until we get a k-coloring of a complete graph
on 2ℓ − 1 + (k − 1)(ℓ − 1) vertices with no monochromatic ℓK2 . Note that this coloring contains no rainbow cycles;
thus, it contains neither a rainbow copy of K3 nor a rainbow copy of K3 + e. Hence, f (k; ℓK2 , H ) = f (k; ℓK2 , H + e) =
(k − 1)(ℓ − 1) + 2ℓ − 1 for any H that is not a forest. By Observation 5, min S (n; ℓK2 , H ) = min S (n; ℓK2 , H + e). In
2ℓ+1
particular, for ℓ ≥ 2, min S (n; ℓK2 , K3 ) = min S (n; ℓK2 , K3 + e) = ⌈ n−ℓ−
⌉ + 1.
1
Case 2. G ∈ {K3 , P4 , C4 }
From [3,2,8,5,6], we have that (i) f (k; K3 , K3 ) = f (k; K3 , K3 + e) = λ(k) for k ≥ 1 and k ̸= 3, f (3; K3 , K3 ) = 10, and
f (3; K3 , K3 + e) = r3 (K3 ) − 1 = 16, where λ(k) = 5k/2 if k is even, λ(k) = 2 · 5(k−1)/2 if k is odd; (ii) f (k; P4 , K3 ) =
f (k; P4 , K3 + e) = k + 2 for k ≥ 1; and (iii) f (k; C4 , K3 ) = f (k; C4 , K3 + e) = k + 3 for k = 2 or k ≥ 4, f (3; C4 , K3 ) = 6, and
f (3; C4 , K3 + e) = r3 (C4 )− 1 = 10. Therefore, from Observation 5, we conclude that (i) min S (n; K3 , K3 ) = min S (n; K3 , K3 +
e) = c log n + c ′ for n ≥ r3 (K3 ) = 17 and some constants c , c ′ ; (ii) min S (n; P4 , K3 ) = min S (n; P4 , K3 + e) = n − 2 for n ≥ 4;
and (iii) min S (n; C4 , K3 ) = min S (n; C4 , K3 + e) = n − 3 for n ≥ r3 (C4 ) = 11. Thus, min S (n; G, K3 ) = min S (n; G, K3 + e)
for G ∈ {K3 , P4 , C4 } and n ≥ r3 (G).
Case 3. G = K1,ℓ
In [9], it was shown that any coloring of E (Kn ) with no rainbow triangles has a monochromatic star K1,2n/5 . Using this
fact and the pigeonhole principle, we easily see that any coloring of E (Kn ) with no rainbow K3 + e has a monochromatic
star K1,(n−1)/3 . Namely, let c be a coloring of E (Kn ) with no rainbow K3 + e. Since 2n/5 ≥ (n − 1)/3, we may assume that
there is a rainbow copy T of K3 . To avoid a rainbow K3 + e in this coloring, the edges between V (T ) and V (Kn ) − V (T ) have
colors only presented on the edges of T . Thus, for any vertex x in T , the number of colors used on edges incident to x is at
most three. By the pigeonhole principle, we can find a monochromatic star K1,s with vertex x and s ≥ (n − 1)/3 vertices
in V (Kn ) − x. This is sharp, as the referee remarked (one can also find it in [6]). Consider a complete graph Kn and partition
V (Kn ) into four subsets V0 , V1 , V2 , and V3 , with |V0 | = 1 and |Vi | = (n − 1)/3 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Color all edges induced by
V0 ∪ Vi with color i for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, and all edges between Vj and Vk with color i for {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}. In this coloring, there
is no monochromatic star K1,s with s > (n − 1)/3. Therefore, S (n; K1,ℓ , K3 ) = S (n; K1,ℓ , K3 + e) = ∅ if n ≥ 3ℓ + 1.
Summarizing Cases 1, 2, and 3, we have that S (n; G, K3 ) = S (n; G, K3 + e) is an interval if G is one of {ℓK2 , K3 , P4 , C4 , K1,ℓ }
and n ≥ N, where N is a constant depending only on G. This concludes the proof of the first part of Theorem 2.
Consider the case when G = C4 , H = K3 + e, and n = 10. Since r2 (C4 ) = 6 < 10, we see that there is no (C4 , K3 + e)good coloring of K10 in two colors. On the other hand, since r3 (C4 ) = 11, there is a (C4 , K3 + e)-good coloring of K10
in three colors. Thus min S (10; C4 , K3 + e) = 3. We also have that max S (10; C4 , K3 + e) = AR(10, K3 ) = 9. Since
f (k; C4 , K3 + e) = k + 3 < 10 for 4 ≤ k ≤ 6, there is no (C4 , K3 + e)-good coloring of K10 with 4, 5, or 6 colors. To
construct an 8-colorings and a 7-coloring of K10 with no rainbow K3 + e and no monochromatic C4 , consider a vertex set
{v1 , . . . , v10 }. Let c (vi vj ) = i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 7, i < j; c (v8 v9 ) = c (v8 v10 ) = c (v9 v10 ) = 8. Let c ′ (vi vj ) = i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 5,
i < j; c ′ (v6 v7 ) = c ′ (v7 v8 ) = c ′ (v8 v9 ) = c ′ (v9 v10 ) = c ′ (v10 v6 ) = 6, and all other edges get color 7 under c ′ . Note that
c and c ′ are an 8-coloring and a 7-coloring, respectively, containing no rainbow K3 and no monochromatic C4 . Therefore,
S (10; C4 , K3 + e) = {3, 7, 8, 9}.

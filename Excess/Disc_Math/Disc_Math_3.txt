1. Introduction
Here, a code C of length n is a subset of the direct product of n copies of the finite field Z2
C ⊆ Z2 × Z2 × · · · × Z2 = Z2n .
The distance between two words x¯ and y¯ in Z2n is the number of coordinate positions in which x¯ and y¯ differ.
The code C is a perfect 1-error correcting binary code, here for short a perfect code, if to any word x¯ of Z2n there is a
unique word c¯ of C at distance at most one from x¯ . Perfect codes have been studied for more than 60 years, and there
are many different constructions; see for example [7]. There is up to ‘‘equivalence’’ just one perfect code of lengths 3 and
7, respectively, but 5983 different perfect codes of length 15, see [17], and the number of different perfect codes of length
n ≥ 31 is extremely large, see [13], although n + 1 always must be a power of 2.
Every permutation π of the set of coordinate positions induces a map on the set of words of Z2n :

π ((c1 , c2 , . . . , cn )) = (cπ −1 (1) , cπ −1 (2) , . . . , cπ −1 (n) ).
The symmetry group of C , denoted Sym(C ), is the set of permutations π of the coordinate positions that do not change C ,
Sym(C ) = {π ∈ Sn | π (C ) = C }.
A Hamming code is a linear perfect code. As observed by Hamming [5] (which will be used in this study), Hamming codes
are null spaces of matrices in which every possible column, distinct from the zero column, appears exactly once. From this
fact, it is rather easy to see the well-known fact that for every Hamming code Hn of length n,
Sym(Hn ) ≈ GL(log(n + 1), 2),

(1)

where GL(m, q) denotes the general linear group of a vector space of dimension m over the finite field with q elements.
It was proved by Malyugin [15] that for every nonlinear perfect code C of length n,

|Sym(C )| ≤

1

|Sym(Hn )|.

The main issue with our investigations is to improve this bound.

We will always assume that all zero word belongs to the perfect codes we consider. The set of all linear combinations of
words of C , denoted ⟨C ⟩, is a subspace of Z2n . The rank of C is the dimension of ⟨C ⟩. The rank of the Hamming code of length
n is n − log(n + 1) and the existence of perfect codes of any possible rank r with n − log(n + 1) ≤ r ≤ n was proved for
any length n ≥ 15 by Etzion and Vardy [3].
Our main result is the following.
Theorem 1. For every nonlinear perfect 1-error correcting binary code C of length n and rank r with n − log(n + 1) + 1 ≤ r < n

|Sym(C )| ≤ |GL(n − r , 2)| · |GL(log(n + 1) − (n − r ), 2)| ·

By using the preparations that will be done in Section 2, the proof of this theorem, that will be given in Section 3, is rather
easy. In Section 4, we will prove that this bound considerably improves the bound of Malyugin [15]; but at this point let us
give one explicit example showing this. The table below shows the upper bound, that we get from our theorem, for the sizes
of the symmetry group of perfect codes of length n = 63 and of different ranks.

The size of the symmetry group of a perfect code of length n and rank r = n − log(n + 1) + 1 was already considered by
Avgustinovich et al. [2]. They showed that there exist perfect codes of rank n − log(n + 1) + 1 and with a symmetry group
of size |GL(log(n + 1), 2)|/n. Furthermore, they proved that this number is the upper bound for the size of the symmetry
group of any perfect code of this rank. As easily seen, this number is also equal to the right hand side of Eq. (3) when
r = n − log(n + 1) + 1.
In Section 4, we will also discuss, how using the results of Section 2 we may rather easily get perfect codes with
different predescribed sizes of the symmetry group of a perfect code. However, we cannot yet construct perfect codes that
have a symmetry group of size equal to the upper bound given by Theorem 1, in the case of a rank strictly larger than
n − log(n + 1) + 1.
It was proved by Heden et al. [9] that for every possible length n ≥ 15 and every possible rank r with n − log(n + 1)+ 3 ≤
r ≤ n − 1 there are perfect codes with a trivial symmetry group.1 Malyugin has shown this fact for perfect codes of length
n ≥ 31 and rank r = n in [14]. This result of Malyugin was confirmed, with another proof than that of Malyugin, by Heden
et al. in [9].
The methods used in our investigations, and developed in Section 2, are not applicable for perfect codes of length n in
the case of rank r = n. The only upper bound for the size of a symmetry group of a perfect code with these parameters and
known to us is the bound given by Malyugin [15]; see Eq. (2).
2. Some preparations
Let C be a perfect code. For any two distinct coordinate positions i and j there is a unique word c¯ of C of weight 3 such
that i, j ∈ supp(¯c ), the support of the word c¯ . Let s(i, j) denote the unique coordinate position such that
supp(¯c ) = {i, j, k = s(i, j)}.
Lemma 1. For any π ∈ Sym(C ),

π (s(i, j)) = s(π (i), π (j)).
Proof. Let c¯ be the word of weight 3 with support {i, j, k = s(i, j)}. Then π (¯c ) is a word with the support {π (i), π (j), π (k)}
and the lemma follows from the definition of the function s.
For any subspace D of the vector space Z2n , let D⊥ denote the dual space of D, that is, the set of words (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Z2n
such that
x1 d1 + x2 d2 + · · · + xn dn = 0,
for all elements (d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ) of D.

1 Recently, Heden et al. [10] have extended this result to the case of perfect codes of length n ≥ 31 and rank r = n − log(n + 1) + 2.

For every permutation π of the set of coordinate positions,
xπ(1) dπ(1) + xπ(2) dπ(2) + · · · + xπ(n) dπ(n) = x1 d1 + x2 d2 + · · · + xn dn ,
and hence, for any subspace L of Z2n ,

π (L)⊥ = π (L⊥ ).
If π ∈ Sym(C ) for a code C , then π (⟨C ⟩) = ⟨C ⟩, and thus from the equation above ⟨C ⟩⊥ = π (⟨C ⟩⊥ ). This proves the next
lemma.
Lemma 2. For any code C ,
Sym(C ) ⊆ Sym(⟨C ⟩⊥ ).
We will call the code ⟨C ⟩⊥ the dual code of C .
We define an equivalence relation on the set of coordinate positions by
i ∼ j if di = dj ,
for all words (d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ) of ⟨C ⟩⊥ . This equivalence relation partitions the set of coordinate positions into equivalence
classes I0 , I1 , . . . , It . We will call this partition the fundamental partition associated with C . From Lemma 2, we immediately
get the following.
Lemma 3. For every π ∈ Sym(C ) and every member Ij of the fundamental partition associated with C ,

π (Ij ) = Ik ,
for some member Ik of the fundamental partition associated to C .
In fact, we can say even more, and which will turn out to be useful in general, by considering the so-called Krotov
components, originally defined by Krotov [12] for perfect codes.
To simplify notation, we make the following enumeration of the set of coordinates. Let sj = |Ij |, and let
Ij = {ij1 , ij2 , . . . , ijsj },
for j = 1, 2, . . . , t. We will always assume that I0 consists of those coordinate positions such that dj = 0 for all d¯ ∈ ⟨C ⟩⊥ .
We now define the outer code of a binary code C . Let D = ⟨C ⟩⊥ . Define a map Pr from the code D to a code Pr(D) of length
t, where t is as above, by
Pr : d¯ = (d0 , d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ) −→ (δ1 , . . . , δt ),
where

δj =

if

di = 1 for i ∈ Ij ,
di = 0 for i ∈ Ij ,

for j = 1, 2, . . . , t. It is clear that Pr is a linear map. The outer code C ⋆ of C is the dual code of this code, that is,
C ⋆ = (Pr(⟨C ⟩⊥ ))⊥ .
Every code2 C can be partitioned into mutually disjoint components, indexed by the outer code C ⋆ of C ,

Let w(¯c ) denote the weight of a word c¯ . From Lemmas 2 and 3 we get the following lemma.

2 All codes in this paper are presumed to be binary codes. A more precise statement than the statement that follows, and that was shown by us in [6],
is that every perfect 1-error correcting binary code can be obtained by the combining construction of Krotov [12]. The generalization of the combining
construction of Krotov to the q-ary case, as well as the proof of the fact that every perfect 1-error correcting q-ary code can be obtained by this combining
construction, was done by Heden and Krotov [8].

Lemma 4. Let C be any binary code of length n. For every π ∈ Sym(C ), and for every component Kh¯ , h¯ ∈ C ⋆ , of C

π (Kh¯ ) = Kh¯ ′ ,
where w(h¯ ) = w(h¯ ′ ).
We finalize these preparations by specializing on perfect codes of length n and a rank r such that n − log(n + 1) + 1 ≤
r ≤ n − 1.
The following two lemmas are due to Hergert [11].
Lemma 5. The dual code of every perfect 1-error correcting binary code C of length n and rank r, is a simplex code of length n
and dimension n − r.
A proof of this lemma, as well as the next lemma, can be found in [1].
Lemma 6. The fundamental partition associated to any perfect 1-error correcting binary code C of length n and rank r consists
of t + 1 = 2n−r sets. The sizes of these sets are

The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Lemma 5 and the definition of a Hamming code. This corollary will
be fundamental when we in the next section derive our upper bound for the size of the symmetry group of a perfect code.
Corollary 1. The outer code C ⋆ of every perfect 1-error correcting binary code C of length n and rank r is a Hamming code Ht of
length t = 2n−r − 1.
Let Cj denote the following set of words of length s and s + 1, respectively,
Cj = {(cj1 , cj2 , . . . , cjsj ) | c¯ = (c1 , c2 , . . . , cn ) ∈ C and supp(¯c ) ⊆ Ij },
where s0 = s and sj = s + 1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , t.
Simple counting arguments, see for example [1], gives the following lemma.
Lemma 7 (Etzion and Vardy [4]). For every perfect 1-error correcting binary code C , the code C0 is a perfect code of length s and
the codes Cj , for j = 1, 2, . . . , t, are extended perfect codes of length s + 1.
Note that in the case of rank r = n − log(n + 1) + 1, then |I0 | = 1 and |Ij | = 2, for j = 1, 2, . . . , t, and the codes C0 and Cj
will consist just of the all zero word.
The words of weight 3 in a perfect code containing the all zero word constitutes a Steiner triple system. This fact was
used by Solov’eva and Topalova [18] and by Malyugin [15] in their search for an upper bound for the size of the symmetry
group of a perfect code. Words of weight 3 will also be essential in this study, but not in the role as members of a Steiner
triple system. We will use the following lemma in our proof.
Lemma 8. For any word c¯ of weight 3 of a perfect 1-error correcting binary code C with an associated fundamental partition
I0 , I1 , I2 , . . . , It there are three distinct possibilities:
(i) supp(¯c ) ⊆ I0 ,
(ii) there is a word of the outer code C ⋆ to C of weight 3 and with the support {i1 , i2 , i3 } such that

|supp(¯c ) ∩ Ii1 | = |supp(¯c ) ∩ Ii2 | = |supp(¯c ) ∩ Ii3 | = 1,
(iii) for exactly one member Ij of the fundamental partition associated to C ,
|supp(¯c ) ∩ I0 | = 1,

and |supp(¯c ) ∩ Ij | = 2.

Proof. Let c¯ be any word of weight 3 of C . As the minimum distance of the outer code C ⋆ to C is 3 and C ⋆ contains the all
¯ every nonzero words of C ⋆ has a weight at least equal to 3. This gives two possibilities: either c¯ belongs to a
zero word 0,
Krotov component Kh¯ where the weight of h¯ equals 3, or c¯ belongs to the Krotov component K0¯ . As the weight of c¯ equals
3, it follows from the definition of Krotov components that the first of these two cases is the case (iii) of the lemma and the
latter case is either the case (ii) or the case (i).
The set of members π of Sym(C ) such that π (Ij ) = Ij , for j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , t, will be denoted Sym0 (C ) and is a subgroup of
Sym(C ). The group Sym(C ) is thus a union of cosets of Sym0 (C ). These cosets may be indexed by a subset K of Sym(Ht ), i.e.,
Sym(C ) =



ϕ ◦ Sym0 (C ),

ϕ∈
¯ K

where, for each coset ϕ ◦ Sym0 (C ), the permutation ϕ can be chosen to be a fixed member of Sym(C ), and

ϕ(
¯ i) = j ⇐⇒ ϕ(Ii ) = Ij ,
for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t.

3. The proof
Let C be any perfect code of length n and rank r where n − log(n + 1) + 2 ≤ r ≤ n − 1.
Every element π of Sym0 (C ) may be considered as a t + 1-tuple

π = (π0 , π1 , π2 , . . . , πt ),
where each component πj can be considered as a permutation of the set Ij .
Lemma 9. For each j ≥ 1 and each ij,ν ∈ {ij,2 , ij,3 , . . . , ij,s+1 }, the value of πj (ij,ν ) is uniquely determined by π0 and the value
of πj (ij,1 ).
Proof. Let ij,ν ̸= ij,1 be arbitrary in Ij . Then by Lemma 8, there is a unique element i = s(ij,ν , ij,1 ) of I0 such that there is a
word of weight 3 with support {i, ij,1 , ij,ν }. Now use Lemma 1.
Let Ht denote a parity check matrix of the Hamming code Ht , the outer code of C , that is, the code Ht is the null space
of the matrix Ht . The rows of Ht constitute a basis for the dual space of Ht , and each possible column of length log(t + 1)
appears exactly once in Ht . We will say that a subset of the coordinate positions {1, 2, . . . , t } is linear independent if the
corresponding columns of Ht are linear independent.
Lemma 10. If the coordinate position k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t } is a linear combination of the linear independent coordinate positions
j1 , j2 , . . . , jρ , then for every π ∈ Sym0 (C ), the permutation πk of Ik is uniquely determined by the permutations πj , for
j ∈ {j1 , j2 , . . . , jρ }.
Proof. Let ik be any element in the set Ik . There are elements i1 , i2 , . . . , iρ in the sets Ij1 , Ij2 , . . . , Ijρ , respectively, such that
there is a word c¯ ∈ C with
supp(¯c ) = {ik , i1 , i2 , . . . , iρ }.
There is only one word in C of weight ρ + 1 that contains the set

{πj1 (i1 ), πj2 (i2 ), . . . , πjρ (iρ )}
in its support. Clearly, as the minimum distance of C is three, this word must be the word π (¯c ), and thus the value πk (ik ) is
uniquely determined by the permutations πj , for j = j1 , j2 , . . . , jρ , (and by C ).
Again, let π = (π0 , π1 , π2 , . . . , πt ) be any member of Sym0 (C ). From Lemma 3, it follows that

π0 (C0 ) = C0 .

(5)

Solov’eva and Topalova [18] proved that for any perfect code C of length s

|Sym(C )| ≤ |Sym(Hs )|,
which of course also immediately follows from the result of Malyugin [15]. Hence we get that the number of distinct
permutations π0 is at most equal to |Sym(Hs )|. To each such feasible permutation π0 there are by Lemma 9 at most s + 1
possible permutations πj (actually for all j = 1, 2, . . . , t). There is a set B of log(t +1) linear independent coordinate positions
such that all other coordinate positions are linear combinations of the coordinate positions in B. By Lemma 10, we may thus
conclude that

|Sym0 (C )| ≤ |Sym(Hs )| · (s + 1)|B| .
From Eq. (4), it follows that

|Sym(C )| ≤ |Sym0 (C )| · |Sym(Ht )|.

(6)

By the relation given in Eq. (1), this is the bound in Theorem 1.
4. Some concluding remarks
We first show that our bound is stronger than that of Malyugin [15], that is, for every integer r with n − log(n + 1) + 1 ≤
r ≤ n − 1,

|GL(log(n + 1), 2)|

Let N denote the integer log(n + 1), let R denote the integer n − r and let S denote the integer log(n + 1) − (n − r ). The
fraction on the left hand side of the above inequality is

1884

O. Heden / Discrete Mathematics 311 (2011) 1879–1885

In the above fraction, the number of factors in the numerator is N and the number of factors in the denominator is R + S, and
thus the number of factors in the numerator and the denominator are equal. Furthermore, every factor in the denominator
is smaller than every factor in the numerator, actually, as R < N and S < N,
2R − 1 < 2N − 2N −1

and

2S − 1 < 2N − 2N −1 .

In particular, and what will be essential here, we note that for each integer k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , R − 1,
2N − 2k
2R − 2k

≥ 2N −R =

n+1
2n−r

,

and the validity of Eq. (7) follows from the fact that R = n − r and the fact that 1 ≤ S ≤ N − 1.
Analyzing the derivation in Section 3 of our new bound, one may observe that we make use of the nonlinearity only when
applying Lemma 3.
To see this, consider any linear perfect code, that is, a Hamming code H of length n and any subspace Dr of dimension
n − r of the dual space of H, where r is any integer in the interval n − log(n + 1) < r < n. There is a subgroup Gr of Sym(H )
defined by
Gr = {π ∈ Sym(H ) | π (Dr ) = Dr }.
If we apply the proof of our main theorem to find an upper bound for the size of this group Gr we will get the expression on
the right hand side of Eq. (3).
However, there are many possibilities to produce nonlinear perfect codes. This fact makes it difficult to use our approach
for further search of a general upper bound for the size of the group of symmetries. Let us give a slightly more precise and
extended discussion of this problem.
One advantage with studying and constructing perfect codes from the point of view of Krotov components is that these
components can be exchanged to get other perfect codes; see [12]. By using such switches it is easy to produce perfect
codes with a symmetry group much smaller than that of a Hamming code. By Lemma 4, Krotov components maps to
Krotov components by the elements of the symmetry group, and hence we can reduce the size of the symmetry group
of a perfect code by exchanging some Krotov components to other components, ‘‘nonisomorphic’’ to the original one. As
Krotov components are enumerated by the outer code C ⋆ , we may then reduce the factor |GL(n − r , 2)| in the bound of our
theorem to some suitable factor |K |, where K is as in Eq. (4).
Another possibility to produce perfect codes with a smaller symmetry group, than that of a Hamming code, is to consider
perfect codes with the property that the code C0 is not a Hamming code. Such perfect codes can easily be found, for example
by using the so-called Phelps construction [16]. The factor |GL(log(n + 1) − (n − r ), 2)| in our bound will then be reduced.
A combination of the above two procedures was used by Heden et al. [9] to produce perfect codes with a trivial symmetry
group.
Summarizing the above discussion, we note that our bound will be achieved just under some very ideal circumstances;
the set K is equal to GL(n − r , 2) and Krotov components of the code map to other Krotov components of the code, the
code C0 is a Hamming code, and furthermore, the words of weight 3 completely determines the symmetry group. So a clever
guess is that no nonlinear perfect code will ever achieve our bound, unless in the particular case of rank n − log(n + 1) + 1,
and thus, we are convinced that the bound given in Theorem 1 is far from being best possible. At least it should be possible to
improve the bound by a factor 1/2, which in this context might be considered as a rather small, really minor, improvement.
A final and necessary remark is that the results of Soloveva and Topalova [18] as well as the result of Malyugin [15]
concerns the full automorphism group Aut(C ) of a perfect code C . This group consists of all couples (¯c , π ) such that

π (¯c + C ) = C .
As we have assumed that the all zero word belongs to all perfect codes that we consider, the word c¯ must belong to C .
Furthermore, the addition of a word will never be equal to a permutation of the set of coordinate positions, although it
might happen that c¯ + C = π (C ) for some word c¯ and some permutation π of the set of coordinate positions. Hence in
general,

|Aut(C )| ≤ |C | · Sym(C ).
In any case of automorphism groups, our result is considerably stronger than that of Malyugin.
Acknowledgments
I am grateful to the two anonymous referees who suggested several improvements of the presentation. In particular,
one of the referees called my attention upon the fact that my proof of the main theorem also holds in the case of rank
r = n − log(n + 1) + 1.

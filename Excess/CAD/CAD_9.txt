abstract
Quad meshes can be interpreted as tensor-product spline control meshes as long as they form a regular
grid, locally. We present a new option for complementing bi-3 splines by bi-4 splines near irregularities
in the mesh layout, where less or more than four quadrilaterals join. These new generalized surface and
IGA (isogeometric analysis) elements have as their degrees of freedom the vertices of the irregular quad
mesh. From a geometric design point of view, the new construction distinguishes itself from earlier work
by a notably better distribution of highlight lines. From the IGA point of view, increased smoothness and
reproduction at the irregular point yield fast convergence.

1. Introduction
A key task in extending tensor-product splines to more general
control nets is building n-sided multi-spline caps that smoothly
glue together n individual tensor-product splines. Such spline
caps are central both for building geometrically smooth (Gk ) freeform surfaces with irregular points, where less or more than four
tensor-product patches join together—and to define the physical
domain and the analysis functions for iso-parametric [1] or
isogeometric analysis (IGA) [2] in the presence of irregular points.
The contribution of this paper is a new

• polynomial piecewise tensor-product cap construction of degree bi-4 that G1 smoothly joins together bi-3 (bi-cubic)
splines,

• results in a good highlight line distribution, better for n = 3 and
some higher n than the curvature continuous bi-7 caps of [3]
and
• yields high-order convergent IGA elements, one per vertex of
the input quad mesh, for solving higher-order partial differential equations, such as thin shell problems.
Overview. After the literature review, Section 2 defines the setup
and tools: multi-sided surface caps, geometric continuity and
shape functionals. Section 3 presents the main construction yielding a G1 surface of degree bi-4 for n-sided caps where n = 5, 6, 7.
As always, special care has to be taken for the case n = 3 (Section 4)
where the results improve even on constructions of much higher
degree. Section 5 addresses caps of valence n ≥ 7. Section 6 tests
the isogeometric elements derived from the new construction.

The literature offers a number of algorithms for complementing tensor-product splines. These range from Catmull–Clark surfaces [4] to the sophisticated patch-based curvature continuous

construction of degree bi-7 [3]. We compare our new construction
to these canonical ones on a collection of challenging test data.
Older as well as most newer constructions of low polynomial
degree, e.g. [5–9], differ from the proposed construction in
that they parametrically C 1 extend the tensor-product patches
into the cap. Recent progress in surface constructions [10,11]
has shown that, for low degree and few patches, immediate
reparameterization of the boundary data is necessary to obtain
good shape. We also include in the comparison [12], an adaptation
of Gregory’s construction [13] that is formally rational of degree
bi-3.
The new bi-4 construction also differs from the bi-4 constructions in [6,7,9] in that it does not require solving equations for
each new input to obtain the surface: evaluation and differentiation are explicit in terms of the vertices of the input quadrilateral
(control-) net, a fact that comes in handy when constructing stiffness matrices for solving higher-order partial differential equations on manifolds. We compare the isogeometric elements based
on the new construction in particular with the results in [14].
The construction [10] mentioned earlier shows that multi-sided
holes in a bi-2 (bi-quadratic) spline complex can be smoothly filled
using caps of n spline patches that are of degree at most bi-4.
However, the bi-2 degree of the underlying spline is crucial for
the construction and [10] cannot be applied to complete the more
widely-used bi-cubic tensor-product spline complexes.
2. Definitions and setup
As a standard abstraction from the real-life complexity of
blending trimmed surfaces, we consider a network of quadrilateral
facets or quads that outline the final surface. Such a quad mesh
might, for example, arise from Catmull–Clark subdivision. Interior
mesh nodes where more or fewer than the regular number of
four quads meet are called irregular nodes. They are 1–1 related
to irregular points where three or more than four surface patches
meet. We assume that each irregular node is surrounded by at
least one layer of regular i.e. 4-valent nodes and apply one step of
Catmull–Clark subdivision should this not be the case. A CC-net c is
a submesh consisting of the irregular node and 6n nodes that form
two layers of quads surrounding it. (The second layer is allowed
to have irregular nodes.) Fig. 1(a) displays a CC-net and Fig. 1(c)
displays an extended CC-net, i.e. CC-net plus one additional layer of
quads. This additional layer is not used for the construction of the
cap but provides a surface ring (green in Fig. 1(d)) surrounding the
cap. This ring allows judging the transition from the spline complex
into the cap, a transition that is as important as the internal quality
of the cap itself. The nodes of a CC-net will act like the control
points of a tensor-product spline.
2.1. Surface representation
A tensor-product patch f of bi-degree d is defined by its
Bernstein–Bézier (BB) coefficients fij as
f(u, v) :=

d 
d


fij Bdi (u)Bdj (v),

(u, v) ∈

:= [0..1]2 ,

i=0 j=0

where (t ) is the kth Bernstein–Bézier polynomial of degree d.
Since each 4 × 4 sub-grid of points of the network is interpreted
as the B-spline control net of one bicubic piece of a tensorproduct spline surface, the well-known formulas of a B-spline to
Bernstein–Bézier (BB)-form conversion [15,16] can be applied to
the CC-net, except at the irregular node. This provides Hermite data
in bi-degree 3 form (see Fig. 1(b), (d)) along the boundary of the
cap. We refer to these Hermite data in the following as the tensorborder b (of depth 2 and degree 3). While our cap will only match

the first derivatives defined by b (after a change of variables), its
second-order Hermite data will enter via samples of a bi-5 guide
surface that propagates curvature from the boundary into the cap.
To explain the algorithmic steps, it will be convenient to capture
position and derivatives at a corner point s of a surface patch f,
js,k f := ∂ui ∂vj f (s) i,j∈{0,1,...,k} ,

f(0, 0), ∂u f(0, 0), ∂v f(0, 0) and ∂u ∂v f(0, 0).
2.2. Geometric continuity
We enforce smoothness as matching of derivatives after change
of variables where two surface pieces f and ˜f are glued together
without overlap: f(u, 0) = ˜f(u, 0). This yields the well-known G1
constraints

∂v ˜f − a(u)∂v f − b(u)∂u f = 0.

that act on each coordinate of a surface independently, can be
viewed as penalizing deviation from a surface of polynomial degree
less than k, see e.g. [17–21,6], since polynomials of degree less than
k are annihilated by Fk and polynomials of bi-degree less than k are
annihilated by Fk∗ .
Penalizing higher-order polynomial terms can be expected to
reduce oscillations of the surface. Since our goal is to complete a
bi-cubic (bi-3) patch complex by multi-sided caps and since the
results of functionals in multi-sided configurations and for nonuniform parameterizations differ strongly from the regular case,
it is natural to test and select functionals when the input is the
control-net of the characteristic map χ of Catmull–Clark subdivision [22]. For these canonical boundary data, we searched the
space with emphasis on the valencies n = 5, 6, first applying
‘pure’ functionals Fk and Fk∗ , k = 2, . . . , 4, and then using linear
combinations to optimize the uniformity of the layout of the BBcoefficients surrounding the irregular point. The best combination
turned out to be F23,3 := F2,3 (J40,3 f), the restriction of the functional

F2,3 := (3F2 + F3 )/4 to the 4 × 4 sub-net

J40,3 f

of the BB-net of the
bi-4 patch f, interpreted as the BB-net of a bicubic patch (see the
black 4 × 4 sub-nets in Fig. 2).
However, when working in 3-space and blending higher-order
data from n ̸= 4-sided neighborhood of an extraordinary point in
a bi-cubic patch complex, the parameterization naturally changes
towards that point. This change is all the more rapid when we
keep the polynomial degree and the number of patches is low. This
may explain why experiments consistently showed that, for setting
degrees of freedom of our bi-4 surface cap in 3-space, even the
best choice F23,3 is ultimately worse than approximating a carefully
crafted bi-5 guide cap g [23] that exploits second-order data of the
tensor-border b for a gentle propagation of the curvature from the
boundary into the cap. We will see evidence of this later in the
paper, e.g. in Fig. 6(h), (i) and Fig. 8. Therefore F23,3 will be used for
reparameterizations whereas a guide surface will determine the
geometric shape near the irregular point.

(b) Adjacent bi-4 patches of the cap; green = reparameterized first-order data

Since the boundary is the degree-raised input boundary, only the
following formulas are required (cf. Fig. 5):

,
16(1 − c)

The denominator term (1 − c) in formula (8) hints at instability
and distortion as the valence n increases. Indeed, already for n = 6,
Fig. 4(b) the reparameterization β is quite non-uniform. Fig. 6(b),
(d), (h) illustrate that bi-4 constructions that set the remaining
2 + 3n coefficients by minimizing functionals, fail to yield good
highlight lines, even when the irregular point is set to the central
limit point of Catmull–Clark subdivision (if not, the results are
worse). In particular, the standard functional F2∗ fares poorly.
We therefore stabilize the construction by approximating a reference surface. The cap construction g of [23] is G2 at the irregular point and joins G1 with the tensor-border data, capturing
also second-order data from the tensor-border. It generates consistently high-quality highlight lines. However, directly transferring jets of the bi-5 guide g yields poor highlight lines: the bi-4
surface and the bi-5 reference surface must be carefully related.
Let σ4 be the map constructed in Section 2.3 (see Fig. 2(c)) and σ5
the map constructed by [23] when the characteristic map χ of Catmull–Clark subdivision provides the tensor-border data. We generate an intermediate bi-4 patch a from the jets at the corner points
s of the reparameterized construction g (see Fig. 7(c)) as
J4s,2 a := J4s,2 (g ◦ σ5−1 ◦ σ4 ).

(9)

Then, as indicated in Fig. 7(d), we average some coefficients that
overlap. Let q be the unique quadratic (expansion) at s := p00 .
Since the circled BB-coefficients of g in Fig. 7(a) are part of J5s,2 (q ◦
σ5 ),
J4s,2 a = J4s,2 ((q ◦ σ5 ) ◦ σ5−1 ◦ σ4 ) = J4s,2 (q ◦ σ4 ).
That is, the coefficients marked as red disks in Fig. 7(d) stem from
J4s,2 (q ◦ σ4 ) and the bi-4 surface is curvature continuous at the irregular point! Since the BB-coefficients of σ4 satisfy (3), (4) it is easy

for each unknown separately once and for all. For 5, 6, 7, we can
therefore compute and tabulate the seven generating functions of
the CC-net. The final surface cap is a linear combination of these
tabulated generating functions, weighted by their CC-net points.
Specifically, since the algorithm works for each coordinate
separately, it can be applied when all CC-net points cm have value
0, except for c0m = 1, for one of m = 1, . . . , 7 (see Fig. 1(a)). This

Now, thanks to referencing a high-quality, higher-degree surface,
we obtain good bi-4 caps for n = 6, Fig. 8 and even for n = 7 Fig. 9.
3.4. Implementation via generating functions
The construction via sampling a guide surface seems unduly
cumbersome. However, due to the relatively short, explicit
formulas (3)–(7) for the dependent BB-coefficients in terms of the
independent BB-coefficients, most of the construction steps are
simple and all are explicit and stable. The minimization (10) yields
a linear system of size n × n that, since the guide is fixed, is solved

sub-nets at the irregular point, needs to be tabulated to construct
a cap or to assemble IGA stiffness matrices.

3.5. Examples and comparison of caps when n ∈ {5, 6, 7}
To stress-test the construction, we concentrate on small
CC-nets that challenge the constructions and reveal their flaws.
Fig. 9(c) shows that, even when n = 7, the highlight lines of the
new bi-4 construction with curvature continuity at the irregular
point are better distributed than those for the best functional F23,3

that is everywhere only G1 . By contrast, Fig. 10 shows failure of
the standard functional F2∗ to generate satisfactory highlight lines
already for n = 5.
Fig. 11 tests the convexity preservation of the bi-4 construction.
Catmull–Clark subdivision, although C 2 everywhere apart the
irregular point, shows poorer highlight lines than the new bi4 construction. Typically Catmull–Clark subdivision does well

the surface oscillates in its vicinity. The effort of the new bi-4
construction in transitioning also yields better highlight lines than
the Gregory patch construction [12] (whose highlight lines at the
irregular point are better distributed than those of Catmull–Clark
subdivision). [12] allows quads to have more than one vertex is of

Fig. 14 shows this solution to be of high quality, better than
the G2 scheme of degree bi-7 in [3]: for n = 3, higher continuity
everywhere does not seem necessary for good highlight lines or
curvature distribution (the new cap is curvature continuous at the
irregular point).
5. Caps for high valences
In practice, valences n > 7 are uncommon and usually a construction for n ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6} suffices. For n = 7, the BB-net of the
new bi-4 cap starts to be very non-uniformly distributed and for

configurations such as Fig. 9(a), the surface quality deteriorates after one Catmull–Clark step. This is unusual since a single refinement step is typically beneficial as it softens transitions. Since we
do not want to rule out valencies n > 7, we briefly develop G1 caps
of good quality, consisting from 2 × 2 bi-4 macro-patches; and we
also sketch an alternative construction that is ‘almost’ G1 .
5.1. G1 2 × 2 bi-4 caps
The 2 × 2 macro-patch construction, illustrated in Fig. 15(a),
(b), transitions G1 across the tensor-border b. That is, the data are
reparameterized immediately—as opposed to more classical constructions that connect C 1 to the tensor-border data and C 1 to innermost subpatches (see Fig. 15(c)). For low degree constructions
such C 1 prolongations are known to result in considerably poorer
quality despite formally an equal set of degrees of freedom (the
degrees of freedom can be counted in Fig. 15(b) vs. Fig. 15(c)).

generalizes (8). (In (8), γ := 1.) Our choice γ def prevents the
high distortion of reparameterized tensor-border b, that limited
the single-patch bi-4 construction to n ≤ 7.
To set the remaining degrees of freedom is non-trivial:
functionals failed even more egregiously than in the single-patch
case. Numerous experiments confirm as a good strategy to reduce
to degree 3 some layers of the bi-4 macro patches, by applying the

Fig. 17. G1 2 × 2 bi-4 construction yields a highlight line distribution competitive
with the bi-7 construction in [3] and the bi-5 guide surface.

For example, in Fig. 15(b), two circled markers are set by
(16) implying that the third also satisfies (16). The remaining
construction is analogous, but more complex than that of Section 3:
the details of inheriting data from the guide map via a careful
reparameterization are explained in the Appendix.
Figs. 16 and 17 give an impression of the good highlight line
distribution of the resulting 2 × 2 cap of degree bi-4. The data of
Fig. 16(d) in particular, rule out fitting the neighborhood of the
irregular point with a single polynomial of low degree as would
be needed to deploy the low-degree (bi-6) versions of [25–27].
5.2. An almost G1 bi-4 cap
As a structurally simpler alternative to the 2 × 2 construction,
we sketch almost-G1 bi-4 caps with the same layout of n patches
as the main construction of Section 3. Here almost refers to small
discontinuities of the normal across the tensor-border. Whereas
deriving surfaces by leaving out smoothness constraints typically
yields poor highlight lines, our almost-G1 caps are based on [23].

Fig. 19. Challenging configuration resulting from a design controlled by a collection
of basic surfaces.

The jets J5s,2 f of the construction [23] (see Fig. 18(a)) are converted

to J4s,2 f and averaged at some overlapping locations as shown
in Fig. 18(b), yielding an auxiliary bi-4 cap a. Arguments as in
Section 3 show a to be curvature continuous at the irregular
point and prove that the bi-4 cap a satisfies the G1 constraints (3),
(4), (6), (7), but not necessarily (5).
The remaining BB-coefficients are fixed by minimizing (10).
Given [23], the derivation of the generating functions is considerably simpler than those of the G1 2 × 2 cap. At runtime, working
with the tabulated generating functions, there is little difference in
the complexity.
The almost G1 bi-4 cap is internally G1 -connected but formally
only G0 -connected to the degree 3 tensor-border. Experiments
consistently show a deviation of the normal of less than 0.1°
(see Fig. 19) so that the surfaces look smooth by industrial
standards [28]. Some challenging high-valence configurations
violate the 0.1° bound and this is visible under scrutiny, e.g. in
Fig. 20(e). One Catmull–Clark refinement step typically enforces
the angle bound so that the surface looks G1 with good highlight
line distribution, even under magnification.
6. Isogeometric analysis
Analogous to the geometric obstacle course (see [29] for data),
we now test the new construction on a finite element obstacle

course. That is, we test the new bi-4 construction as generalized
IGA element on a set of standard problems: Poisson’s equation
on the disk and Koiter’s thin-shell analysis a part of the shell
obstacle course. Here both the physical domain X and the analysis
functions uk (e.g. measuring displacement) are represented as a
linear combination of the G1 generating functions hk,m of (11). We

form N generalized IGA elements uk ◦ x−

where N is the number of CC-net control points ck and the physical
domain manifold X is assembled as a superposition of maps xk
that are generating functions weighted by ck . Since both uk and
xk are G1 with the same reparameterization, C 1 continuity of the
generalized IGA elements across irregular points is guaranteed
according to [30].
Since the exact solution of Poisson’s Equation

is well-known, we can plot the error in the finite element
approximations for various refinements of the input mesh (see
Fig. 21 for two valences; the circular boundary is captured exactly
as a rational quadratic). For the input mesh Fig. 21(a), the graphs
Fig. 22 compare the error convergence of the generalized IGA
element built from the single-patch-per-quad bi-4 construction
of this paper, the bi-5 elements of [14] and an element built
from [10] (see also Table 1). As expected, the increased degree of
the bi-5 elements yields a lower error and the lower degree of the
elements from [10] a higher error than our new bi-4 elements. The
L2 convergence rate however, is comparable. In the same graph,
but for the input mesh of valence n = 7 of Fig. 21(b), we compare

the single patch bi-4 construction to the 2 × 2 bi-4 construction.
Again the more complex construction has a slightly lower overall
error. In all cases the L2 convergence is slightly higher than O(h3 )
and the L∞ convergence is slightly higher than O(h2 ) ([10] actually
achieves a rate of O(h3 ) but its L∞ error is higher overall). The L∞
error distribution at the first refinement is shown in Fig. 21(c), (d)
and, again in Fig. 21(e), (f). Unsurprisingly, the error is maximal at
the irregular points.
Next, we analyze two instances of Koiter’s shell model [31]
based on Kirchhoff–Love assumptions that lines normal to the
‘middle surface’ in the original configuration x¯ remain normal to
the middle surface in the deformed configuration x, and that there
is no transverse shear strain and stress. The displacement vector
field u(θ1 , θ2 ) = x(θ1 , θ2 ) − x¯ (θ1 , θ2 ) of the thin shell is found by
minimizing the total potential energy function

where b is the body force, t is the traction on some parts Γt of
the shell, αij + θ3 βij is the Green–Lagrange strain tensor, H is a
3 × 3 matrix incorporating the metric, and E and ν are the Young
modulus and Poisson’s ratio, respectively.
Both the sphere-under-load and the Scordelis–Lo roof benchmark problem of the shell obstacle course [32] are modeled as
(a(x, y), b(x, y), c (x, y)) where the map (x, y) : R2 → R2 is constructed by our algorithm while the maps a, b, c : R2 → R are
analytical functions.
Fig. 23 shows the result for one octant of the sphere under
the axis-aligned loads at two corner points. The displacement
along one axis is color-coded in Fig. 23(b). Fig. 23(c) compares the
convergence of the new bi-4 scheme to two other generalized IGA
elements, built from [10] and from [14].

Fig. 24. Scordelis–Lo roof thin shell.

For the Scordelis–Lo roof, we intentionally chose an irregular
quad mesh for approximation as shown in Fig. 24(a). The error is
measured by tracking the maximum displacement of the midpoint
on the edge aligned with the cylinder’s axis. We see that, despite
the irregular layout, the value of this fourth-order differential
equation converges to the benchmark value. In Fig. 24(c), the
results of the analysis are compared to [10,14], showing rapid
convergence in all cases.

(isogeometric analysis) elements have as their degrees of freedom
the vertices of the irregular quad mesh. As expected, the L2
convergence rates are higher than those of linear elements. The
rates are around 9–10 for Poisson’s equation on the disk, i.e. do
not reach 24 , the rate of Poisson’s equation on the square without
irregular points.

7. Discussion and conclusion

The work was supported in part by NSF Grant CCF-1117695.
Charles Loop kindly provided the generating functions for the
comparisons with [3].

We presented a surface cap construction of degree bi-4 that
improves on the state of the art for layouts that include irregular
points. The improvement has been validated as a good distribution of highlight lines on a collection of challenging test data and
by using the caps for IGA computations. Remarkably both the exact G1 bi-4 construction (for n < 8), and the 2 × 2 macro-patch
bi-4 construction for higher valences yield highlight lines on par
with more sophisticated exact G2 constructions. The constructions
display better highlight lines than the existing algorithms of equal
or lower degree. A complex guiding surface construction is baked
into the formulas of the new bi-4 construction, thereby transferring the guide’s good shape and approximation properties to the
central point of the cap. The final formulas express the surface in
terms of the B-spline-like quadrilateral control net with one generating function associated with each vertex of the control net.
The purely polynomial setup, of degree bi-4 means that
evaluation and differentiation are cheap and generalized IGA
is relatively easy to implement. It is convenient that the

tension of σ4o . This leaves γ in (14) as the final tenth free parameter. Having eliminated dependent BB-coefficients symbolically so
far, we set the ten parameters by minimizing numerically the functional F2,3 over all four sub-patches of σ4 . In particular, this yields
the formula for γdef in (14).
We calculate numerically σ5−1 ◦ σ˜ , where σ˜ := λ−1 σ4o (see
Fig. 25(a)), and λ is the subdominant eigenvalue of Catmull–Clark
subdivision. (Experiments show that if we set σ˜ := σ o without the
virtual Catmull–Clark step when applying the bi-5 guide, the shape
is worse.) An intermediate bi-4 2 × 2 macro-patch a is constructed
as follows. We apply one Catmull–Clark subdivision step to the
initial CC-net and sample the bi-5 guide surface g using σ5−1 ◦σ˜ . The
samples J4s,2 (g◦σ5−1 ◦σ˜ ) are averaged at some overlapping locations
as indicated in Fig. 25(b) to yield the central bi-4 patch ao . Applying
the strategy illustrated in Fig. 25(c) (including first the correction
of the sampled patch a◦ via the degree-reduction operations ◦|, ◦
and ×) yields the full macro-patch a.
As in Section 3, the quadratic expansion at the central
k ,o
point 0, reparameterized by σ4 , is expressed in terms of the
BB-coefficients (red disks in Fig. 5) closest to the irregular point.
This leaves as degrees of freedom in the G1 strips the BB-net
indicated by black disks in Fig. 25(d). The remaining BB-coefficients
are pinned down by the G1 constraints and the degree reduction
(16). The BB-net marked by black diamonds are free to choose,
while the gray underlay indicates that we choose a C 2 extension to
the adjacent subpatches. Overall this leaves 13n free points. These
are fixed by minimizing the functional F4 over the differences
between 4n subpatches of pk and ak .
Note that, of the four pieces of the macro-patch, only the one
closest to the irregular point needs to be tabulated since the other
ones are defined by simple formulas of C 2 -extension at the junction
of the four pieces, C 1 -extension between pieces of the G1 strips, the
G1 -extension of the tensor-border data and pattern (16).

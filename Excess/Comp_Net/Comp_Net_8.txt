The large number of broadband users and its forecast growth has recently triggered
research on energy-efﬁciency in digital subscriber lines (DSLs). A promising technique
are low-power modes (LPMs) as standardized in asymmetric DSL 2 (ADSL2) which let
the DSL connection operate in downstream direction with reduced transmit rate and
power. We study the problem of optimizing the LPM rate-level for energy-efﬁciency. A trafﬁc-independent rate setting is proposed based on an analytical competitive framework.
Also, a Markov chain based LPM model is derived which facilitates the fast numerical optimization of the LPM rate-level under realistic trafﬁc models and system constraints. Simulation results under various trafﬁc settings and DSL scenarios demonstrate energy savings
by LPMs of around 30–40% of the ADSL2 transceiver’s power consumption. Furthermore,
they provide insights on how to set the LPM rate-levels in practice for energy-efﬁcient
DSL operation.

1. Introduction
Low-power modes (LPMs) are a standardized [1] technique in asymmetric digital subscriber lines 2 (ADSL2)
aiming at reducing the power consumption at the central
ofﬁce (CO) side of the DSL link by reducing the downstream transmit rate and power. Our focus is on the optimization of the transmit rate in the LPM with respect to
the expected average energy consumption. An optimization framework is proposed covering the case where one
has no knowledge of the trafﬁc arrivals, and the case where
the distribution of arrival rates is known. In the latter case
of known statistics we further distinguish between a
worst-case analysis valid for any arrival distribution, and
a more speciﬁc analysis based on a Markov chain model
of the trafﬁc and LPMs. This Markov chain model results
in reduced simulation times which allows the exploration

of a larger set of simulation assumptions and scenarios.
Furthermore, it assumes knowledge of a limited set of trafﬁc statistics only, and captures LPM characteristics such as
multiple LPM levels and time delays between power-mode
changes.
1.1. Motivation and related work
The initial motivation for LPMs in DSL was the reduction of the heat dissipation and consequently cooling
power needed at the CO [2] where typically a large number
(up to thousands [3]) of DSL connections are terminated at
the DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM). The LPM rate-level
was supposed to be just high enough to keep up the basic
DSL functionality (e.g., synchronization) and basic telephony services such as the voice-over-Internet protocol
(VoIP). However, recently energy reduction itself has become an important design criterion in DSL [3,4], having impacts on system scalability (e.g., cooling requirements) and
telco’s operational expenditure (OPEX) and CO2 footprint.
The European code of conduct on energy consumption of
broadband equipment [4] even sets design goals for the
energy consumption of DSL equipment. For example, a

power reduction by approximately 30% in the low-power
state is foreseen for ADSL2 by 2014.3 The saved energy at
the transceiver side results in an at least as high extra energy
saving in the facility support equipment at the CO, a fact
known as the ‘‘cascade effect’’ [5,6] or power usage effectiveness (PUE) [7]. Also, in [6] energy saving modes were found
to be the most beneﬁcial energy reduction strategy at the
CO, a result based on the energy reduction targets in [4]
and to a large extent in consequence of the cascading effect.
This conclusion is further strengthened by the typically low
usage of the DSL link. In [8] a network forecast of Telecom
Italia for 2015–2020 is given. Therein the link usage (fraction of time the connection is used) and utilization (demanded data-rate compared to the maximum achievable
rate) in the wired access network are quantiﬁed by 30%
and 10%, respectively. In [9] private DSL and triple-play
users are estimated to use the link less than 10% and 35%,
respectively. Similarly, the study in [10] highlights that the
time when the aggregate network trafﬁc in North America
is within 5% of the peak value over the day is only around
2 h, and in [11] the average Internet usage per day for Bavaria (Germany) was even reported to be as low as 37 min
(2.6%). This indicates the potential for improving the energy
efﬁciency in DSL by introducing LPMs and adaptive transmission rates. Summarizing, the efﬁciency of LPMs depends
on the time operated in LPM and the transmit power spent
in LPM. However, both the time spent in the LPM as well
as the transmit power grow with increasing LPM rate, making the optimization of the LPM rate for energy-efﬁciency a
non-trivial (e.g., non-convex) and, in general, trafﬁc-dependent task.
Fig. 1 illustrates the functionality of LPMs in ADSL2 [1].
For example, one may deﬁne a delay between the time the
trafﬁc rate falls below the (single) LPM rate-level and the
time the system enters the LPM state. Furthermore, the
system exits the LPM instantaneously in order to avoid a
user-perceived delay. The exit from the LPM state potentially causes instability in the network as it leads to
changes in transmit power and hence in crosstalk noise received on other lines. We refer to [2,12–14] for studies
showing the effects of LPMs on network stability and various solution approaches. The study in [14] is most related
to our work, where buffer-state dependent policies were
analyzed for switching between given power modes.

3
The precise targets foresee an energy reduction from 3.4 W in the fullpower state to 2.4 W on the customer side and from 1.1 W to 0.7 W on the
CO side.

Differently, in the present study we focus on the problem
of selecting the rate at the LPM by analyzing the trafﬁcdependent energy savings.
Various proposals besides LPMs have been reported on
how to save energy in DSL, for instance by the design of energy-efﬁcient hardware modules [15–17], by the dimensioning and energy-efﬁcient operation of the network
processor [18], by wireless trafﬁc aggregation at the user
side and efﬁcient line-card usage at the network side [19],
by restricting the maximal margin and power cutback
[20], or by the deployment of street cabinets [21–23]. The
latter allows reducing the transmit power by shortening
the cable length, and to reduce cooling requirements
[24,25] by reducing the number of installed line cards. In
[26] various techniques were used jointly to achieve a
power reduction of around 30% in speciﬁc ﬁeld trials. We
refer to [3] for an overview on energy saving aspects in DSL.

1.2. An estimate of the achievable energy savings
The transceiver’s line-driver (LD) accounts for nearly
50% of the ADSL2 based DSLAM’s energy consumption
[3]. Furthermore, the LD power consumption scales with
the transmit power [15,27], where for ADSL2+ transceivers
a maximal LD power reduction of 85% is possible by transmit power reduction [15]. This conforms to the predicted
energy proﬁle for DSLAMs in [8], showing an energy scaling potential of roughly 45% of the power consumption
in full-power state. Differently, in [3] the energy savings
by LPMs were more conservatively estimated at 20%. In
[2] maximum savings of 420 mW were found in a speciﬁc
experimental setup, which assuming a power consumption
of an ADSL2 line-card of 1.2 W (the consumption target for
2011–2012 in [4]) corresponds to a saving of 28%. To obtain a concrete estimate of the energy saving potential of
LPMs we assume a power consumption of an ADSL2 linecard of 1.2 W [4], an average saving in LD power consumption of 64%,4 a share of the LD-power in the line-card’s
power budget of 50% [13], and a multiplicative energysaving factor of 2 due to the PUE [3,5,6]. Altogether we
obtain an energy saving potential of 6.7 kWh (or 0.67 Euro
assuming an energy price of roughly 10 cent/kWh [28])
per year and DSL line.
4
This number is based on an average link usage of 20% and a potential LD
power reduction in LPM during idle-times of 80% [15], resulting in an
average saving potential of (1 À 0.2) Â 0.8 = 0.64.

1.3. Outline
We begin in Section 2 with an analysis of the rate-selection problem for LPMs in DSL. This parameter setting problem can be regarded as a degenerate online problem [29],
which is concerned with making decisions under incomplete information on the future (e.g., trafﬁc) requests and
therefore the exact cost of the decisions. We will similarly
analyze the LPM problem ﬁrst from a competitive perspective, i.e., the trafﬁc is considered to be optimized by an
adversary. We refer to [30] and references therein for
applications of competitive analysis in the design of dynamic power management policies. Alternatively, in Section 3 we develop a Markov model of the trafﬁc on a
session level allowing for a fast performance evaluation
and optimization of LPMs. Note that in practice the LPM
rate-level should be optimized based on the actual link
usage statistics. Using the proposed model we demonstrate
how trafﬁc statistics can be integrated into LPM simulations, and exemplify the performance gain by optimizing
the LPM rate-level by means of a speciﬁc set of such statistics. This model is then also extended to capture sequential
LPMs and delay between LPM states. Differently to the
energy saving estimate in Section 1.2 which is based on
the average link usage, this approach provides estimates
through a bottom-up modeling of the trafﬁc and allows
explicitly showing the impact of the optimization of LPM
rate-levels and delay on the energy savings. Simulation results are provided in Section 4 under numerous rate-selection policies, system constraints, and DSL network
scenarios. Our conclusions are summarized in Section 5.
2. Optimization models for low-power modes
We consider a single multi-carrier DSL transmission
system and denote its transmission rate by q.5 We assume
a monotonously increasing power cost function c(q) > 0
which maps the rate q, 0 6 q 6 R, to the power consumption
of (parts of) the modem, where R is the maximum rate supported by the DSL system. As a practical example we use in
our simulations the gap-approximation of the channel
capacity in [31], additional noise [13] to account for the ﬂuctuations in crosstalk noise caused by changing power modes
on other lines connected through the same cable binder,6
and optimal greedy bit-loading [33] to compute the necessary transmit power for rate q, and further map the transmit
power to the power consumption of the line-driver c(q)
through the model in [15].7 Furthermore, we abstract the
(shaped) incoming trafﬁc-rate by the marginal probability
density function (pdf) p(q), 0 6 q 6 R, where we initially
do not assume any knowledge of p(q). We restrict our atten-

tion to systems which, beside the maximum rate R, support
a ﬁnite number of L pre-deﬁned low-power modes with corresponding rates r 2 L ¼ f~r 2 RL j0 6 ~r 1 6 . . . 6 ~rL 6 Rg.
Assuming the system always transmits at a rate at least as
high as the arrival rate, the expected total power under
the LPM setting r is given as

2.1. Optimization under an unknown trafﬁc arrival
distribution
Intuitively we consider a LPM setting r 2 L a good
choice if it results in a similar expected cost Cp(r) to that
of the ideal system C⁄,p. Therefore we deﬁne our objective
as the ratio of these two costs,8 leading to the worst-case

Note that in case we had solely considered Cp(r) as our
objective, the above question of the worst-case trafﬁc
would lead to the trivial solution p(q) = 0, for 0 6 q < R,
and p(R) = 1, and an arbitrary LPM setting r, which once
more motivates the chosen ratio of costs in (3). Using the
logarithmic cost function cdB(q) = 10 log10(c(q)) the following result provides the analytical solution of the problem in
(3).

Other methods which have been proposed to cope with the variation in
interference noise induced by LPMs are for instance a frequency-selective
LPM and a slow LPM exit procedure [32].

Next let us assume that we have knowledge about the

Intuitively, this should result in a cost somewhere between
our worst-case analysis in Section 2.2 which was not based
on any knowledge of the arrivals and their statistics, and
the ideal system which follows the trafﬁc rates in time.
Knowledge of p(Á) can be modeled by interchanging the

respectively, cf. Appendix B for a description of the computation of these bounds and the speciﬁc pdf settings. These
bounds solely depend on c(R) and c(0) which are set based
on the chosen ADSL2+ line-driver model [15] in Fig. 2 and a
maximum transmit power of 19.3 dBm [34, Annex B].
Comparing the bounds under pexp(q) and puni(q) for linear
cost functions in Fig. 3 we ﬁnd that the uniform distribution leads to a better LPM performance. The maximum value of the bound under a uniform pdf puni(q) in Fig. 3
occurs for costs with a degree of approximately 6.8, while
the limiting value for d ? 1 is 1. Fitting the function in (7)

The given cost functions were chosen as they resemble the practical
cost functions we use in simulations in Section 4. Furthermore, they are
convex and therefore lend themselves for an analytical solution of the LPM
rate-setting problem in (6).

to the cost functions used in the simulations in Section 4
we ﬁnd an average degree d in 1000 DSL scenarios of 2.4
(minimum 2.1 and maximum 2.8) with artiﬁcial noise
and 3 (minimum 2.6 and maximum 3.2) without artiﬁcial
noise, respectively, cf. Section 4 for details. In general the
exact degree will depend on the considered noise and network scenario, the used line-driver model, etc.
Two important cases in practice, as we shall analyze by
simulations in Section 4, are L = 1 and L = 2. While the
above results assumed speciﬁc pdfs, the following structural result characterizes the two-level LPM solutions independently from the pdf p(Á).

Note that Theorem 2 offers a possibility for reducing the
optimization complexity in the case of L = 2, as will become
clearer in Section 3.1. We proceed in the following sections
p
by analyzing the ratio CC Ã;ðrÞ
p for more realistic trafﬁc pdfs
p(Á).
3. Modeling low-power modes based on Markov chains
We derive a Markov model suitable for the fast performance evaluation of LPMs. We will begin in Section 3.1 by
modeling each application as an on/off source and combining these sources in a joint Markov model of all trafﬁc. Next
we assign costs to subsets of the trafﬁc arrival states
according to the LPM deﬁnition to arrive at an LPM model
in Section 3.2. Furthermore, in Section 3.3 we will show
how this model can be extended to account for constraints
encountered in practice.
3.1. Markovian trafﬁc model
We model the arrival trafﬁc on a session-level based on a
ﬁnite set of M broadband applications indexed by
M ¼ f1; . . . ; Mg, such as Internet protocol television (IPTV),
video streaming, web, peer-to-peer (P2P) ﬁle sharing, interactive gaming, and voice-over-IP (VoIP). We denote by
sm 2 {on,off} the state of application m 2 M. When an application is in the on-state (sm = on) it outputs a speciﬁc (aver-

age) data-rate qon(m) bps, while in the off-state (sm = off) it
delivers a data-rate qoff(m) = 0 bps. The set of all trafﬁc states
generated by the possible on–off combinations for the M
applications is denoted by S ¼ fsjsm 2 fon; offg; m 2 Mg,
where jSj ¼ N ¼ 2M . The arrival rate q(s) in a speciﬁc state
s 2 S is the sum of the rates per application qsm ðmÞ in the
associated per-application states sm ; m 2 M, i.e.,

We build a 2-state Markov model for each application m

second based on the transition matrix Tðm;hÞ 2 R2Â2
þ ,
ðm;hÞ
where, e.g., T on;off is the transition probability from the
on-state to the off-state, cf. Fig. 4. The transition probabilities are obtained from application speciﬁc data on session characteristics given in [36,37] as follows: The
average time in the (Markovian) on-state follows a geoðm;hÞ
metric distribution with mean value 1=T on;off . Correspondingly we have

where t(m) is the average session duration10 in [s] of appliðm;hÞ

matrix T(m,h) follows from irreducibility [38] which holds for
ðm;hÞ
instance by assuming non-zero probabilities T ðm;hÞ
on;on , T on;off ,
ðm;hÞ
ðm;hÞ

cf. Fig. 5 which exemplarily depicts our LPM Markov model

L = 1 and then searching the two-level LPM rates in a restricted search space. More precisely, instead of evaluating
the objective of all N(N À 1)/2 combinations for r1 and r2,
we exhaustively search the value of the lower LPM rate
r1 in the restricted interval [0, r⁄] and test the objective values for all combinations with the higher LPM rate r2 in the
restricted interval [r⁄, R].
3.3. Delayed and sequential low-power modes (LPMs)

3.2. LPM Markov chain
We proceed by extending this Markov chain of the trafﬁc to model LPMs. For that purpose we partition the set of
states S into exclusive subsets S ðiÞ ; 1 6 i 6 L þ 1, where

Note that the chosen data leads to a transition matrix T(m,h) with strictly
positive entries and therefore to an irreducible chain with unique steadystate distribution [38].

For reasons of network instability due to crosstalk
among the copper lines deployed in the same cable bundle
two timing constraints for LPMs have been introduced in
the ADSL2 standard [1]: (a) a minimum time between
the exit from and following entrance in the LPM and (b)
a minimum time before the ﬁrst power-trim in the LPM
and between consecutive power trims, cf. the successive
transmit power reduction indicated in Fig. 1. Both can take
integer values between 0 and 255 s, cf. [2] for recommended settings. We therefore make the practical assumption that LPMs can only be changed to the next lower LPM
(e.g., from LPM l to LPM l À 1) after a certain delay, while
the full-power mode can be activated instantaneously in

order to avoid quality of service (QoS) degradation. The
LPM model of Section 3.2 can be extended in a straightforward way to capture these requirements as schematically
depicted in Fig. 6. Therein we partition the set of states S
into non-exclusive subsets S ðiÞ ; 1 6 i 6 L þ 1, where

and write TSðiÞ ;S ðjÞ to denote the partial transition matrix
from all states s 2 S ðiÞ to all states s 2 S ðjÞ . Furthermore,
(D + 1) denotes the number of seconds the arrival rate
has to be below the LPM rate in order to go into the corresponding LPM. Note that the full Markov model has now
O(N Á L Á D + N Á L + N) states for the waiting periods, the
LPMs and the full-power mode, respectively. The average
cost is now computed similarly as in (18) with the waiting
states having an associated cost of the next higher LPM or
full-power mode, respectively. Note that multiple power
trim procedures [1] can be modeled in a similar fashion
with multiple delay queues per LPM and different associated costs. A possibly speciﬁed minimum time between
an LPM exit and re-entrance [1] or a slow wake-up from
any LPM to the full power state [32] can be modeled by a
state queue with transitions T(h) and appropriately assigned costs per state, similarly as in Fig. 6. In such a queue
one moves from one state to the next at every time instance, thereby modeling a ﬁxed (i.e., trafﬁc-independent)
time delay.

4. Performance evaluation
We evaluate the performance of LPMs with one or two
rate-levels and with or without waiting delay before entering an LPM by simulation of an ADSL2+ system.

4.1. Simulation parameters
We uniformly sample 1000 network topologies with
loop-lengths between 500 m and 3000 m, considering
downstream transmission, British Telecom cables of type
‘‘BT-dwug’’ with 0.5 mm diameter [40], artiﬁcial noise
(AN) calculated as the interference from 49 collocated disturbers added to a background noise of À120 dBm/Hz, the
bandplan deﬁned in [34, Annex B] with non-overlapped
spectrum operation over the Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN), a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gap C [31]
of 12.8 dB (consisting of 9.8 dB modulation gap, 6 dB SNR
margin, and 3 dB coding gain), and a maximum sum-power
of 19.3 dBm. The trafﬁc model is as described in Section 3
based on the session characteristics in [36,37] with M = 7
selected services.12 This results in N = 128 trafﬁc states
and an equal number of possible arrival rates, out of which
we can select the LPM rate-levels r 2 RLþ , cf. Section 3.2. This
trafﬁc model results in an average link usage (fraction of
time the DSL link is used) over the day of 16.8% and an average (over scenarios and time) link utilization (fraction of the
maximum achievable rate demanded by the user when the
link is used) of 14.7%. Conﬁdence intervals are given according to a Student’s t-test with a conﬁdence level of 99%.
4.2. Average single-level LPM performance
We compare the single-level LPM under various rate
setting policies to the continuously rate-adaptive system
which upper-bounds the performance of LPMs, i.e., under
any rate-setting r and number of LPMs L.

4.2.1. Optimal LPM rate setting
The results for the achieved average energy savings are
presented in Fig. 7 and Table D.1 in Appendix D, beginning
with those considering AN as discussed in Section 4.1.
Neglecting AN we obtain lower energy savings and a lower
objective ratio than in the case with AN, cf. Fig. 7. This is
explained by the fact that for short-loop scenarios, differently to the case with AN, the system is rather constrained
by the maximum bit-cap constraint (15 bits). This leads to
a lower total transmit power and hence LD-power at maximum rate than for long-loop scenarios and therefore to a
lower saving potential by LPMs on average. The savings
for long loops are however higher without AN than with
AN, cf. Section 4.4 for an example. Assuming twice the
number S(m) of sessions per day (and AN as above) we obtain a higher average objective, i.e., a higher average suboptimality of single-level LPM in comparison to
continuous rate adaptation, cf. Table D.1 in Appendix D.
Intuitively this can be explained by the higher variability
of the trafﬁc rate which results from the higher number
of sessions. The average link usage over the day is now
30.8% and the average (over scenarios and time) link utilization is as high as 16.1%. This is somewhat comparable to
the home access utilization forecast for 2015–2020 in [8]
where the predicted link usage and utilization are 30%
and 10%, respectively.

In Fig. 8 we compare the LPM rate setting policies in
terms of the solutions (rate-levels) depending on the loop
length. Empirically we observe that the optimal rates decrease with the loop-length, which seems to be an intuitive
consequence of the cost c(r) which increases with the looplength. Considering the line labelled ‘‘(a)’’ in Fig. 8 as the
base-line, we see that a higher number of sessions (cf. the
line labelled ‘‘(b)’’) makes higher LPM rates more efﬁcient
as the time one spends in the LPM increases. Neglecting
the artiﬁcial noise (cf. the line labelled ‘‘(c)’’) has a similar
effect, with the explanation now being the lower cost c(r)
which again makes higher LPM rates more efﬁcient.
4.2.2. Fixed LPM rate setting
Next we set the LPM rates independently of the considered trafﬁc and network scenario. Regarding the worstcase LPM setting of Section 2.2 under the standard parameters of Section 4.1 (i.e., including AN) we naturally obtain
a lower value for the energy savings than above as the LPM
rate-level r is not optimized for the speciﬁc trafﬁc at hand,
cf. Fig. 7. The same is true for the ﬁxed setting of the LPM
rate-level at r = 128 kbps and r = 0 kbps, respectively.13 The
13
When r = 0 we are not entering LPM unless there is no arrival trafﬁc.
The motivation behind a ﬁxed LPM rate at 128 kbps is that voice calls are
supposed to be supported during LPM operation.

objective ratios in Table D.1 under the optimal worst-casetrafﬁc LPM rate setting in Section 2.2 is even on average
close to the theoretical maximum of 2.57 (e.g., 2.48 for the
case with AN). When doubling the number of sessions the
optimal LPM rate-level increases and the performance of
setting the LPM rate to zero drops, cf. Fig. 7. The worst-case
rate setting however leads to LPM rates much above the
optimal rate-level, and doubling the number of sessions
has consequently little impact on the energy-savings, cf.
the lowest bar in Fig. 7. Another observation is that a large
part of the energy savings (e.g., 74.7% out of the possible
84.3% with AN) can be achieved by simply setting the LPM
rate to 128 kbps, especially when the link utilization is low.

4.2.3. A rule of thumb for setting the LPM rate
We observe that the optimal LPM rate under AN (cf. the
line labelled ‘‘(a)’’ in Fig. 8) drops at around 2 km to a ratelevel of 357.8kbps. This is in fact the sum-rate under the
three services video streaming, gaming, and ﬁle-sharing,
which, besides IPTV, have the largest session durations
among the M chosen services, cf. Section 4.1. Considering
this selection as a ‘‘rule of thumb’’ we investigate the average performance of this LPM rate selection strategy in Fig. 7.
We see that the achieved energy savings are somewhere
between those under the optimal LPM rate selection and
those under the setting r = 128 kbps. Especially when twice
the number of sessions are considered we see a substantial

energy saving compared to the other ﬁxed-rate LPM settings as the speciﬁc rate-levels of certain applications with
long session durations has been taken into account.
As the energy savings by optimal LPM rate selection under AN are similar for different line-lengths (cf. the maximum and minimum savings in Table D.1), and due to the
increasing simulation times with an increasing number of
LPM and delay states, we proceed by investigating an
ADSL2+ scenario with the loop-length ﬁxed at 2500 m.

4.3. Multi-level LPM performance
By increasing the number of LPM rate-levels we expect
a lower average power consumption and therefore higher
energy savings compared to maximum rate transmission.
In Fig. 9 we compare the ideal continuously rate-adapting
system’s performance (‘‘Upper-Bound’’) to that under
(optimally adjusted) single and two-level LPM. While the
optimal single-level LPM setting achieves 77.70% of energy-savings, the two-level LPM setting achieves 83.43%,
close to the savings achieved by continuous rate adaptation (83.96%). As seen in Fig. 10 the optimal rate-levels
for two-level LPM are 0.357 Mbps, which is the optimal
rate-level for single-level LPM, and 3.772 Mbps. This example reminds us of the result in Theorem 2, with the important difference that in the simulations we enter LPMs
sequentially.

4.4. LPM performance with delay
A delay between state-changes has been proposed as a
stabilization method agains crosstalk noise ﬂuctuations
due to LPMs [2], which can be regarded as an alternative
or an add-on to the usage of AN above. This delay can be
modeled using additional delay-states as shown in Section 3.3. In Fig. 11 we show the achieved energy-savings
by single-level LPM compared to the full-power mode in
the exemplary ADSL2+ scenario with a 2500 m long loop.
The impact of the delay on the energy-savings for standardized values of D (D 6 255 [1]) can be seen to be fairly
small (<1% of the full-power mode LD power consumption), i.e., much less pronounced than the impact of multiple LPMs observed above. The curve simulated without AN
seems to be the least inﬂuenced by the delay. We note that
differently to the average behavior analyzed above, here
we obtain a higher saving without AN compared to the

curve simulated with AN, a behavior we attribute to the
bit-cap constraint as explained in Section 4.2.

5. Conclusions
An initial calculation of the energy-saving potential by
enabling low-power modes (LPMs) in asymmetric digital
subscriber lines 2+ (ADSL2+) results in an estimated total
energy saving at the central ofﬁce of 6.7 kWh per year
and DSL line, based on an assumed average saving in
line-driver (LD) power consumption of 64% of the full
power consumption. Our bottom-up approach based on a
Markovian trafﬁc and LPM model and a ﬁxed, low LPM rate
provides comparable ﬁgures (60–75%). The proposed optimization of the LPM rate-level gives additional savings by
trading-off the power consumption in the LPM state and
the time spent in full-power state, resulting in up to 80%

2478

average savings in LD power. The introduction of multiple
LPM levels leads to another 2–7% power savings. Both, the
optimization of LPM rate-levels and multiple LPMs were
seen to be most effective when the link usage is high
(e.g., above 25%) and/or the considered background noise
(and hence the rate-cost) is low (e.g., no disturbance from
other DSL systems). While we saw that the optimal LPM
rate setting depends on various factors, as a rule of thumb
the average rates of the low-rate applications with the longest session times (in our case video, ﬁle-sharing, and gaming) can be used for an energy-efﬁcient setting of the LPM
rate in practice. The studied approach of setting the LPM
rates based on worst-case trafﬁc assumptions was seen
to be overly conservative under realistic trafﬁc, especially
under a low link usage. The introduction of delay between
the entrance into LPM states was seen to have little effect
on the achieved energy savings, most likely due to the low
link usage.
Summarizing, we propose a methodology for the analysis of LPMs with different levels of trafﬁc knowledge, with
potential applicability for other communication systems. A
single low-power mode under a ﬁxed LPM rate setting
accomplishes to save the bulk of the possible energy savings by LPMs in DSL. The optimization of the LPM rates
based on the actual trafﬁc statistics bears an additional
saving potential which is most visible under a high link
usage (e.g., above 25%).

The new generation of wireless networks is characterized by heterogeneity i.e. the coexistence
of two or more radio access technologies (RAT) in the same geographical area. While this
coexistence of RATs offers various advantages, it also imposes many challenges for the network
operator, whose aim is to maximize the generated revenue while satisfying the customers’
increasing demands. One important mechanism in heterogeneous wireless networks (HWN)
is the RAT selection. It is normally triggered when a new call arrives, and provides the decision
on whether the call can be admitted or not, and by which RAT it has to be served. Different
approaches can be used to tackle the problem of RAT selection in HWNs. In this paper, we
study Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based RAT selection in a cellular/WLAN heterogeneous
network where the maximization of the revenue is considered as objective. An optimal RAT
selection policy is therefore derived. The performance of the optimal scheme is evaluated in
comparison with two other policies, namely Cellular-First policy and Load Balancing policy.

1. Introduction
The new generation of wireless networks is characterized
by heterogeneity where two or more radio access technologies (RATs) coexist in the same geographical area. The coexisting RATs may have different, but often complementary
characteristics in terms of coverage, latency and link capacity. This trend of multiplicity of RATs is also expected to be
dominating in the future for the many advantages it offers.
These advantages include, among others, multiple connectivity options, and an expansion of the coverage at a relatively
low structure cost [1]. However, this imposes additional challenges for the operator especially in ﬁnding means of coordination among the coexisting RATs.
Getting full advantage of the combined features of the
deployed RATs is crucial for the network operator. On one

hand, this can be explained by the fast increase of demands
from users with high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements,
coupled with the proliferation of bandwidth-hungry applications widely available on smart phones, and electronic devices. On the other hand, the wireless resources are very
scarce as compared to the growing demands. Therefore, the
operator has interest in making the best utilization of all
available resources to increase the capacity of the network
and meet, as much as possible, the users’ expectations and
demands.
Heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs) provide many
opportunities for capacity improvement. Considering the
case of a cellular/WLAN overlay network, WLAN can play
an important role in alleviating some of the problems encountered by the cellular network in terms of congestion and coverage (WLAN oﬄoading [2]). By deploying access points (APs) in speciﬁc targeted areas such as cell
edges, and hotspots, considerable amount of traﬃc can
be carried by the WLAN [3], thus increasing the network
capacity.

Cellular and WLAN have complementary characteristics.
On one hand, broadband cellular networks such as 3GPP Long
Term Evolution (LTE) can implement quite complex resource
management schemes, more eﬃcient QoS and wider coverage than WLAN. On the other hand, WLAN is characterized
by its cheap deployment and access costs, small coverage and
limited QoS guarantees. A network operator can, through an
eﬃcient management of the joint pool of resources of both
RATs, take advantage of their combined features to increase
the overall system performance and consequently generate
higher proﬁt.
Managing resources in HWNs involves setting up policies
that regulate the amount and type of traﬃc served by each of
the RATs. These regulations may vary depending on whether
the adopted scheme is user-centric or operator-centric. For
instance, considering the user’s perspective, the objective is
usually to guarantee the best achievable QoS such as low delay and blocking probabilities or high throughput. The operator, however, would be more interested in maximizing the
network’s capacity in order to accommodate the maximum
number of users and increase the generated revenue.
A well known key mechanism for resource management
in HWNs scenarios is RAT selection. It consists of taking a decision, at each arrival of a new call request, on whether to
accept this call or not, and the RAT to which it can be admitted. A well-designed RAT selection policy allows a better assignment of the traﬃc to the available access networks, increasing the number of sessions that the system can
accommodate.
Different approaches can be used to tackle the RAT selection problem in HWNs. In the present work, we investigate
Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based RAT selection with
the objective of maximizing the operator’s revenue. Different user proﬁles with their respective QoS requirements and
charged prices are considered, and a preferential treatment is
provided to the proﬁle that is charged higher fees. Moreover,
the spatial distribution of the base stations (BSs) and APs (for
the cellular and WLAN respectively), and that of the users in
the HWN are taken into account in modeling the traﬃc.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized
as follows:
(1) Investigation of the MDP-based approach for RAT
selection, with focus on revenue maximization as
objective.
(2) Considering the operator’s policy of granting different
levels of priority to the different classes of service, the
reﬂection of this policy by tuning the parameters of
the MDP model is discussed.
(3) The coverage probability of WLAN is analytically modeled with the help of Poisson Point Process (PPP).
(4) The spatial distribution of the users is also captured
with PPP.
(5) Evaluation of the performance of the MDP-based RAT
selection with comparison to two other static RAT selection schemes.
(6) Highlight on the role of WLAN in traﬃc oﬄoading and
improving the perceived QoS.
The remaining of the paper consists of the following
parts: Section 2 presents the motivation and related work
in the literature. Section 3 describes the system model. In

Section 4, the components of the MDP problem are presented. Section 5 discusses the revenue maximization problem. Section 6 presents and analyzes the obtained results. Finally, we conclude this study in Section 7.
2. Motivation and related work
Broadband cellular networks, despite their great
promises, might not be able to fulﬁll the expected increase in demands of data traﬃc in the near future [4]. This
incites the network operators to be in perpetual search for
solutions that alleviate the problem of increasing traﬃc load,
and WLAN has been considered as one appealing candidate
to complement the cellular network. For example, WiFi
oﬄoading is of great importance for the different advantages
it provides, namely the usage of unlicensed spectrum, being
a well-established technology, and more importantly all new
smart phones, and electronic devices planned for 4G have
the features of WiFi radio embedded, a trend that is likely to
continue for 5G as well.
In order for the network operator to beneﬁt from the
WLAN capacity to alleviate the load on cellular network, a
strategy for the distribution of traﬃc among the two RATs is
needed. This can be partly realized through the implementation of an eﬃcient RAT selection mechanism. While different
approaches can be used in dealing with RAT selection problem, MDP is a good candidate for this optimization owing to
its appealing properties.
MDP can be deﬁned as a Markov chain with the addition
of an action model and a performance criterion. It has been
widely applied in various areas such as ecology, economics,
and network routing [5]. In the case of RAT selection problems, MDP is also an intuitive stochastic control approach.
Even though MDP suffers from a dimensionality problem
when the number of states in the MDP is increased to represent a large number of connections, some approaches have
been suggested in the literature (such as in [6]) where approximation solutions are provided. One other example can
be found in [7] where a reduced dimension MDP-based call
admission control scheme has been proposed. The results in
[7] show a great reduction in the complexity of the original
MDP model, making it practical and cost-effective for implementation in HWNs. We believe, with such solutions, the effectiveness and the promising results of MDP-based schemes
can be exploited by the network operators. Nevertheless, in
this paper, our focus is on investigating the effectiveness of
using MDP to maximize revenue generation in HWNs. For
this reason, we shall only consider the original MDP, leaving
its simpliﬁcation to future study.
In the literature, several RAT selection policies have been
proposed. In [5], a threshold-based framework for call admission control has been provided and different objective
functions have been proposed and investigated. In [8], the
authors proposed a heuristic RAT selection scheme in colocated wireless networks which aims to enhance the user’s
QoS in terms of minimizing the call blocking probability. In
[17], a stochastic process algebra is used to build a framework for network selection strategies in 3G-WLAN networks. Different strategies are evaluated, namely general
non-deterministic strategies (random strategy and relative
received signal strength (RRSS)-based strategy), WLAN-ﬁrst

and service-based. The considered performance measures
(average throughput, handover rates and RAT blocking probability) which aim to compare the performance of the different schemes, take into account the user’s and the network
operator’s perspectives. However, no speciﬁc objective function is considered. Few RAT selection schemes have been proposed with the aim of maximizing the operator’s revenue
such as [9,10]. However, the adopted pricing scheme is not
taken into consideration. Pricing is a very important factor,
and has a direct impact on the network’s generated revenue.
An important aspect in cellular/WLAN HWNs scenarios is
the spatial distribution of BSs, APs and users. Some of the
proposed RAT selection schemes in the literature took the
users and BSs’ distribution into account such as [11,12]. However this has been done through a decomposition of the cell
into rings and sectors, and by considering users belonging
to the same zone to be having the same geometrical property. None of the mentioned work has included an analytical
model for the spatial distribution of the APs and the users.

and tractable model for HWNs, by offering a statistical modeling for the spatial distribution of users and base stations
of each tier. In fact, PPP model has been used extensively
for modeling unplanned networks [14] which is typically the
case of WLAN APs’ deployment. In our considered scenario,
the different aspects of the PPP model can be described as
follows:

3. System model

3.2.1. Coverage probability
The cellular system has global coverage i.e. all users in the
considered HWN fall under the coverage of the cellular RAT.
Therefore, the coverage probability of cellular is Pc,1 = 1.
As for the coverage probability of WLAN, it can be derived
with the help of PPP as follows. First, we assume that each
AP covers a circular area of known radius R, i.e. the transmission of each AP can be received clearly by users residing at a distance not exceeding R. Second, the interference
from neighboring APs is considered negligible. Hence, a typical user is said to be under the coverage of WLAN if the distance r separating this user from the nearest AP is less than R.
Therefore, the probability that a user is under WLAN coverage is equivalent to the cumulative distribution function of r,
namely P[r < R]. Without loss of generality, we consider that
the typical user is located at the origin of the plane under
consideration [14]. Then, knowing that the null probability of
a 2D Poisson process in an area Z is exp( − λZ ) [15], we can
derive the coverage probability of the WLAN Pc, 2 as follows:

3.1. Network architecture
We consider the case of a cellular/WLAN overlay network
such as, for example, in [13]. A typical example that can be
met nowadays is an LTE/WiFi HWN. The traﬃc arrivals to the
different base stations are independently distributed. Hence,
and without loss of generality, we can shift our focus to a single cell Ctarg that corresponds to the coverage area of one cellular BS. The cellular RAT has global coverage, overlaying the
WLAN i.e. within the coverage of the considered BS there exist one or more WLAN AP(s).
In the studied system, we consider two user proﬁles or
classes, namely class 1 and class 2 with different priority levels. Class 1 traﬃc, which is charged higher price, is granted
higher priority. It targets mainly the business sector’ users
who have strict requirements on QoS, and are less sensitive
to the charged prices. Class 2 traﬃc has normal priority and
targets individual users who prefer to pay low monthly fees
and can tolerate some degradation of their perceived QoS. All
users belonging to the same proﬁle are charged identically.
The role of the MDP-based RAT selection scheme is to
ﬁnd the optimal distribution of the traﬃc among the existing RATs which leads to the maximization of the objective
function (the revenue in our case).
3.2. Spatial distribution
Because of the overlay nature of our studied HWN scenario, a connection request might occur either in an area that
is covered by the cellular RAT only, or in a dual coverage area.
In the latter case, the call can be admitted to the cellular or
the WLAN depending on the decision provided by the RAT
selection policy. Here arises the need of getting knowledge
regarding the spatial distribution of the three players in this
scenario, namely the BSs, APs, and the users. The considered
network architecture can be seen as a 2-tier heterogeneous
network, where tier-1 is the cellular and tier-2 is the WLAN
RAT. A spatial point process, such as PPP provides a concise

• The positions of BSs/APs belonging to tier-k are modeled
according to a homogeneous PPP φ (k) with intensity λ(k) ,
where λ(k) is deﬁned as the number of BSs/APs per area
unit, and k ∈ {1, 2} with k = 1 refers to the cellular RAT
and k = 2 refers to the WLAN.
• Users are also scattered in the plane according to an homogeneous PPP φ (u) with intensity λ(u) users per area
unit, independently of φ (k) .
Through PPP modeling, different metrics can be captured.
In the following, we derive (1) the probability for a user to be
under tier-k’s coverage, and (2) the traﬃc arrival rates.

(2) R2

P[r > R] = P[φ (2) ∩ b(0, R) = 0] = e−π λ

(1)

where b(0, R) is the Euclidean ball of radius R centered at origin. Hence, the coverage probability of tier-2 is given by:
(2) R2

Pc,2 = P[r < R] = 1 − P[r > R] = 1 − e−π λ

(2)

3.2.2. Traﬃc arrivals and holding times
Having two user proﬁles generating traﬃc to the system,
we deﬁne ψ as the ratio of class 2 users to the total number
of users, and (1 − ψ) that of class 1 users to the total number
of users residing in the system. And with the assumption that
users of class i, i ∈ {1, 2} generate traﬃc following a Poisson
distribution with average σ i calls/s, the traﬃc arrival rates λ1
and λ2 of classes 1 and 2 respectively can be easily derived as
follows:

λ1 = σ1 (1 − ψ)λ(u) |Ctarg | arrivals/s

(3)

λ2 = σ2 ψλ(u) |Ctarg | arrivals/s

(4)

where |Ctarg | is the area of the targeted cell Ctarg (in area unit).

60

E. Khloussy et al. / Computer Networks 91 (2015) 57–67

As for the call holding time for class i, traﬃc of both
classes is assumed to be inelastic, i.e. the average duration of
the service is independent of the allocated number of channels, and following exponential distribution with mean 1/μi ,
i ∈ {1, 2}.
4. Markov Decision Process formulation
An MDP model is provided to derive the optimal RAT selection policy which maximizes our objective function. This
model can be uniquely identiﬁed by ﬁve components: the
state space, decision epochs, action space, state dynamics
and the reward function. We deﬁne each of these components in the following sections.
4.1. State space
The state space represents the number of ongoing sessions in the HWN i.e. the number of class 1 sessions being
served in the cellular RAT, number of class 1 sessions being
served in the WLAN, and similarly, number of class 2 sessions being served in cellular and those in WLAN. For ease
of representation in MDP, we model the problem with one
particular AP in WLAN that we call the targeted AP. Hence,
a 4D-MDP serves to build our model. On the other hand, we
assume a ﬁxed total capacity for both RATs, each being partitioned into a ﬁxed number of basic bandwidth units (bbu) as
in, e.g. [13,16,18]. This implies that a limited number of sessions can be served simultaneously by each RAT. The total
capacities of the cellular and the WLAN RATs can be deﬁned
as integers that we denote by C1 and C2 , respectively. Any
new arriving call that cannot be granted its required amount
of bbu is blocked. Thus, by restricting the number of ongoing connections in the system, the delivered QoS to different
connections can be maintained at a certain target level. Considering that each session of class i requires bi bbu, we can
deﬁne the following row vectors:
• state vector of the cellular RAT: s1 = [n1,1 , n1,2 ] ∈ Z2+
• state vector of the WLAN RAT: s2 = [n2,1 , n2,2 ] ∈ Z2+
• state vector of the system: s = [s1 , s2 ] = [n1,1 , n1,2 , n2,1 ,
n2,2 ]
where nj, i denotes the number of sessions of class i in RAT j,
and Z+ represents the set of non-negative integer numbers.
Hence, the state space S of the system, which is the set of all
feasible states where the QoS conditions in both RATs are not
violated, becomes:

S = s = [s1 , s2 ] = [n1,1 , n1,2 , n2,1 , n2,2 ] ∈ Z4+ ,
n1,1 · b1 + n1,2 · b2 ≤ C1 , n2,1 · b1 + n2,2 · b2 ≤ C2 }

(5)

4.2. Decision epochs and actions
At each arrival of a class i session request, i ∈ {1, 2}, the
RAT selection policy makes a decision on the admission of
the new session. A decision epoch occurs at each new session
request. It is deﬁned as the time following immediately an
arrival event. As for the events of call completion, they do
not require any decision to be taken by the system.
The action taken following each decision epoch can be deﬁned as a vector a = [a1 , a2 ] where ai denotes the action resulting from the arrival of a class i session. A decision can be

either to admit the arriving session to cellular RAT, admit it
to WLAN or block it. ai can be deﬁned as follows:

ai =

⎧
⎨−1, if the session is admitted to cellular,
⎩

1, if the session is admitted to WLAN,
0,

if the session is blocked.

The action space of the MDP is deﬁned as the set of vectors
a as follows:

A = {a = [a1 , a2 ], a1 ∈ {−1, 0, 1}, a2 ∈ {−1, 0, 1}}

(6)

However, for a given state s ∈ S, the decision should always lead to a state s that is also in S. Moreover, when
the system is in state (0,0,0,0), the action (0,0) should be
avoided in order for the system to keep evolving. Hence,
for a given state s = [n1,1 , n1,2 , n2,1 , n2,2 ] ∈ S, the state action
space As ⊂ A is given by:

As = a ∈ A : ai = −1 if [s1 + eui , s2 ] ∈
/ S,
ai = 1 if [s1 , s2 + eui ] ∈
/ S,
/ S and [s1 , s2 + eui ] ∈
/ S,
ai = 0 if [s1 + eui , s2 ] ∈
a = (0, 0) if s = (0, 0, 0, 0)

(7)

where eui ∈ {0, 1}I is a row vector of zeros except for the ith
element which is equal to 1, (I being the number of traﬃc
classes, I = 2). s1 + eui corresponds to an increase of the sessions of the ith class by 1 in the cellular RAT. s2 + eui corresponds to an increase of the sessions of the ith class by 1 in
the WLAN. The admission of a class 1 session, to either cellular RAT or WLAN, might involve the vertical handover of
one or more class 2 sessions. This handover can be performed
from cellular to WLAN or vice versa.

4.3. State dynamics
The state dynamics of the MDP are deﬁned by two parameters, namely the expected sojourn time and the transition
probabilities.

4.3.1. Expected sojourn time
The sojourn time τ (s, a) is deﬁned as the expected time
for the system to stay in state s ∈ S given that action a
∈ As is chosen, until a new state is entered. The sojourn
time is used to compute the transition probabilities for a
continuous-time MDP, and its value can be expressed [5,9] as
follows:

τ (s, a) =

2

i=1

λi |ai | +

n j,i μi

(8)

i=1 j=1

where λi is the arrival rate for class i traﬃc, i ∈ {1, 2}, deﬁned
by (3) and (4) for i = 1 and i = 2 respectively, and 1/μi is the
mean value of the call holding time of class i.

4.3.2. Transition probabilities
Let Pss (a) denote the transition probability from state s =
[s1 , s2 ] ∈ S to state s ∈ S, s = s , provided that action a ∈ As is

5. Pricing scheme and revenue maximization problem

4.4. Policy and reward function
For each state s = [s1 , s2 ] ∈ S, an action a ∈ As is chosen
is a set of admissible
according to a policy π s ∈ , where
policies deﬁned as:

= {π : S → A|πs ∈ As , ∀s ∈ S}

(10)

The reward function for choosing action a ∈ As , when the
system is in state s ∈ S can be deﬁned as follows:

r(s, a) = w1,1 · δ( − a1 ) − kc,w · nh,2 · h
+w2,1 · δ(a1 ) − kw,c · nh,2 · h
+w1,2 · δ( − a2 ) + w2,2 · δ(a2 )

where w j,i ∈ R+ is the weight associated with the admission of a class i session into RAT j, R+ being the set of nonnegative real numbers, kc, w is the cost associated for handing off a class 2 session from the cellular network to WLAN,
and kw, c is the cost associated for handing off a class 2 session from WLAN to the cellular network. The ﬁrst two lines
in (11) show that the gain obtained from the admission of a
class 1 session to the cellular network (resp. WLAN) is computed as the weight associated to this admission minus the
cost incurred by the eventual handover of class 2 sessions.
This reﬂects the fact that the handover is not favorable unless the gain obtained is the highest achievable gain among
all possible solutions. However, the admission of a class 2 session, being a low-priority traﬃc, does not invoke any kind of
handover.
By solving the MDP, an optimal policy π ∗ that maximizes
the reward function can be found. The values of the weights
and the handover costs in the reward function (11) have to
be deﬁned based on the objective that the operator wants
to maximize. The RAT selection module will, based on the
optimal policy provided by the MDP, decide on the admission
or rejection for every arriving session as explained in Fig. 1.
A summary of the notations used in the paper is presented in Table 1.

(11)

Pricing of services is highly important, and has a substantial impact on user satisfaction and operator revenue. Various
pricing schemes have been proposed and studied in the literature. These schemes include ﬂat-pricing, volume-based, and
dynamic pricing. A comprehensive survey on pricing practices and their predominance in different parts of the world
can be found in [19].
Pricing and revenue are tightly related. The term revenue, as used in this paper, indicates the charges collected
from the subscribers in monetary unit (MU). It is function
of the charged prices and the number of subscribers belonging to the different offered proﬁles. In our studied scenario, we try to maximize the network’s income by prioritizing the admission of class 1 users to the system, for their

higher contribution in the generated revenue. This can be reﬂected by the appropriate choice of the weights in the reward
function (11).
The weights are important system parameters that affect
the decisions taken by the admission controller, and different
combinations of weights may lead to different optimal policies π ∗ . By varying the values of these weights, the network
operator can shape the admitted traﬃc, in order to reach a
speciﬁc goal, such as balancing the traﬃc load, increasing the
generated revenue, or it could be a combination of more than
one objective.

6. Numerical results
In this section, the performance of the optimal MDPbased RAT selection scheme is analyzed. To solve the MDP
problem and ﬁnd the optimal policy, we used the relative
value iteration algorithm from the MDP toolbox (developed
by [20]). The system parameters used in our analysis are depicted in Table 2. A higher value was assigned to kc, w than
that of kw, c because the handover to WLAN comes at a higher
risk due to its local coverage. We also assume hereby that the
price Pri , charged for class i, is chosen as: Pr1 = 2 · Pr2 .

The following performance metrics were chosen to compare the abovementioned schemes.
6.2.1. Average revenue
The average revenue (in MU) depends on the charged
prices as well as the average number of sessions that the system can admit for each of the user proﬁles. It can be computed as:

Class 1 Blocking Probability

The aim of the MDP-based scheme is to ﬁnd the optimal
policy for RAT selection that maximizes the deﬁned objective function. We analyze the performance of this “ Optimal”
scheme by comparing it to the performance of two static
policies which we model with the help of Markov chain. The
ﬁrst scheme is the “ Cellular-First” scheme which works as
follows: all arriving traﬃc is admitted to the cellular RAT as
long as this latter has available resources. When the cellular
network becomes overloaded, class 2 traﬃc is sent to WLAN
while class 1 traﬃc is admitted to the cellular network if it
was possible to free the needed resources by handing off a
part of class 2 traﬃc to WLAN. In case the handover was not
possible, the traﬃc is sent to WLAN if this latter had enough
resources, and blocked otherwise. The second scheme, called
“ Load Balancing” policy, as suggested in [21], works as follows: when a session arrives, it is admitted to the RAT where
its admission results in the minimum load (the load of a
RAT being the ratio of occupied channels over the total available channels). In the case where the admission of the session results in same load for all existing RATs, the policy selects randomly the RAT to accommodate the newly arriving
session.

6.3. Results
The values of the considered performance metrics for the
Optimal RAT selection scheme, as well as for the Cellular-First
and Load Balancing schemes are depicted in Figs. 2–4. These
values are for load of class 1 traﬃc ρ 1 varying from 2 to 14
Erlang (E), load of class 2 traﬃc ρ2 = 6 E, and for coverage
∗ = 0.6. The values for the
probability of the targeted AP Pc,2
weights in the reward function are chosen as follows: w1,1 =
2, w1,2 = 2, w2,1 = 1 and w2,2 = 1, where a higher weight
is assigned for the admission of class 1 traﬃc, reﬂecting the
higher priority granted to this latter.

6.2.2. Blocking probability
A class i session is blocked, in general, when none of the
two RATs has free bi bbus available, or when the session is
initiated out of the coverage of the WLAN and the cellular
RAT has no enough free resources to accommodate it. In the
case of Optimal and Cellular-First, where handover of class 2
traﬃc is allowed, the computation of the blocking probability
of class 1 takes also into account whether a vertical handover
of class 2 session(s) makes the admission of class 1 traﬃc to
a congested network possible or not.

Among the three studied policies, the Optimal policy provides the highest revenue (Fig. 2). The Optimal policy is hence
able to ﬁnd the optimal traﬃc distribution that can generate
the highest proﬁt among the compared policies. Cellular-First
policy achieves lower revenue than the Optimal policy, but is

able to outperform the Load Balancing policy, which is due
to the fact that admitting to cellular RAT ﬁrst will take better advantage from the large capacity and global coverage of
this network, while WLAN is used only as extension to the
cellular RAT when this is needed.
In terms of blocking probabilities, the results show that
the Load Balancing policy achieves the lowest blocking probabilities for both class 1 and class 2 traﬃc. This is because this
policy takes the load of the RAT as criterion for the decision of
admission of the incoming traﬃc, which makes the probability of a call being blocked lower than with the two other policies. The blocking probabilities obtained through the Optimal
policy are higher than the two other policies. This can be explained by the choice of the weights that is revenue-based
only and does not account for the difference in the QoS of the
two networks. Assigning equal weights for the admission of
a class i session to both cellular RAT and WLAN means that
the Optimal policy will not differentiate between the different grades of QoS that an admitted session might undergo in
the different RATs.
For an operator, whose interest is to maximize the proﬁt
generated from its HWN, MDP solution is a good candidate.
It not only guarantees the highest proﬁt, but it also keeps the
QoS at a comparable level to the ones obtained with the Load
Balancing scheme.

6.4. Effect of the weights
The decisions taken by the Optimal policy are directly affected by the values of the weights (w1, 1 , w1, 2 , w2, 1 and w2, 2 )
in the reward function. It is therefore important to have a
good insight on the choice of these weights. For this purpose, we experiment hereby with different combinations of
weights values and analyze their impact on the average revenue. Nine sets of weights were selected for this comparison
as shown in Table 3. For ease of illustration, we assign the
value of 2 to Pr1 and 1 to Pr2 . The weights wj, i in the nine deﬁned sets were chosen in a way that a weight for the admission of a class i session varies between 0 and Pri , which is an
intuitive choice having the maximization of revenue as our

objective. However, w1, 1 was ﬁxed to Pr1 to reﬂect the higher
priority granted to class 1 traﬃc to be admitted to cellular
RAT where a better QoS can be offered.
First, we examine the revenue obtained by the different
sets of weights for a varying traﬃc load of class 1, and for load
of class 2 ρ2 = 6 E (Fig. 5). The plots show how the achieved
revenue can vary with the chosen set of weights. Among all
sets, set 9 performed the worst. This is obviously due to the
fact that, in this latter, the weights for admission to WLAN
for class 1 and class 2 is set to zero meaning that the MDP
will favor the admission of both traﬃc to the Cellular RAT,
and the beneﬁt from the capacity of WLAN is minimal. The
highest revenue was obtained from set 2 when the load of
the system was relatively low (ρ 1 < 12). However, when the
load increases, set 1 outperforms set 2. This can be explained
as follows: when the traﬃc is low compared to the system
capacity, it is more beneﬁcial to assign lower value for w2, 1
(such as in set 2) which is translated by a lower admission
of class 1 traﬃc to WLAN, while the cellular RAT has enough
capacity to accommodate the incoming traﬃc. On the other
hand, when the system is overloaded, the capacity of
cellular RAT will not be enough to serve the traﬃc, and admitting more traﬃc to WLAN would result in an increase of
the system capacity and, consequently, a higher revenue can
be achieved.
Due to the heterogeneous nature of the traﬃc, we also
compared the revenue achieved by the nine sets of weights

for different values of traﬃc mix (ρ1 + ρ2 ), namely (1) low
traﬃc mix and (2) high traﬃc mix. In Fig. 6, the revenue is
depicted for a low value of traﬃc mix (ρ1 + ρ2 =10 E). When
ρ
class 2 traﬃc is dominating, i.e. ρ +1ρ is low, the performance
1
2
of all sets of weights is very close except for set 6 and set
8 (plot of set 6 overlaps with that of set 8 in Fig. 6). This is
because these two sets favor the admission of class 2 sessions to WLAN. However, when class 1 traﬃc dominates i.e.
ρ1
ρ1 +ρ2 > 0.6, the weights for the admission of class 2 traﬃc
become less important, and therefore the revenue obtained
from sets 6 and 8 becomes closer to that of the other sets of
weights.
The revenues obtained from the different sets of weights
for a high traﬃc mix (ρ1 + ρ2 =20 E) are depicted in Fig. 7.
In this case, we see a clearer differentiation of the revenues
obtained from the different weights, and the highest revenue
is obtained by set 1, which complies with the results deduced
from Fig. 5. The results obtained hereby showed that the set
of weights that provides the maximum revenue varies with
the traﬃc load and traﬃc mix. The network operator can
therefore, based on an a priori knowledge of the traﬃc distribution and patterns, use the appropriate set of weights in
order to maximize the gained proﬁt.

6.5. Effect of the coverage probability of WLAN
In Section 6.3, we evaluated the performance of the MDPbased RAT selection scheme along with two other policies,
for the same value of the coverage probability of WLAN. Because of its importance, we try hereby to further investigate
this parameter. Two values of the WLAN coverage probabil∗ = 0.6 and P ∗ = 0.3, and the
ity are considered, namely Pc,2
c,2
results provided by the MDP-based RAT selection policy for
these two values are shown in Figs. 8–10, where ρ 1 varies
from 2 to 14 E, and ρ 2 is ﬁxed to 6 E. In terms of revenue,
it is shown that, due to a loss in the WLAN resources, it is
not possible to achieve the same revenue as when WLAN has
wider coverage (Fig. 8). Similarly, a negative effect on the
blocking probability for both classes of services can be noticed (Figs. 9 and 10). When the WLAN has very low coverage, it is no more capable of alleviating the load of cellular
RAT which becomes congested faster. Therefore, the role that
WLAN can play in increasing the capacity of the cellular network is important, allowing the system to serve a larger number of users. A wider coverage of the WLAN results not only
in higher generated revenue but also in a better QoS for both
class 1 and class 2 traﬃc.

RAT selection strategies are key components in heterogeneous wireless systems, where more than one RAT coexist, and multiple user proﬁles are supported each having
different QoS requirements. In this paper, we study the performance of MDP-based RAT selection in a cellular/WLAN
heterogeneous network, with the objective of maximizing the revenue of the overall system. For performance evaluation, we compared the Optimal policy derived from MDP to
two other RAT selection policies: Cellular-First and Load Balancing. The results show that, even though the MDP-based
Optimal scheme makes a negative effect on the blocking
probabilities, it achieves the highest revenue among all policies. In addition, to better understand and provide insights
into the MDP-based scheme, the impact of the weights in the
MDP objective function has been investigated for different
traﬃc loads and traﬃc mix values. Finally, the importance
of the role that WLAN plays in oﬄoading the cellular RAT is
highlighted.

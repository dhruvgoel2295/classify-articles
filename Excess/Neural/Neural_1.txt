abstract
In this paper, the synchronization problem for neural networks with stochastic perturbation is studied
with intermittent control via adaptive aperiodicity. Under the framework of stochastic theory and Lyapunov stability method, we develop some techniques of intermittent control with adaptive aperiodicity
to achieve the synchronization of a class of neural networks, modeled by stochastic systems. Some effective sufficient conditions are established for the realization of synchronization of the underlying network.
Numerical simulations of two examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results obtained in the
paper.

1. Introduction
Complex networks are playing more and more important
roles in our today’s society. A complex network is characterized
by a large set of nodes that are connected through a set of
links for the communication and interaction purpose. Many real
world phenomena, such as those appeared in telecommunication,
biological formation, chemical reaction, neural networks, social
organization, the World Wide Web, . . . etc., can be described or
modeled by complex networks. Since the seminal papers that
started to discuss the ‘‘small-world’’ and ‘‘scale-free’’ properties
(Barabasi & Albert, 1999; Watts & Strogatz, 1998), the study of
complex networks is not only becoming one of the main research
areas in the network society but also brought a great of attention
from researchers of different fields. With the viewpoint of complex
dynamical networks, many interesting and important dynamical
behaviors, such as synchronization, consensus, self-organization,
combinatorial optimization, and spatiotemporal chaos of spiral
waves, have been studied (Arenas, Guilera, Kurths, Morenob, &
Zhoug, 2008; Guan, Liu, Feng, & Wang, 2010; He, Li, Huang, & Li,

2013; Wen, Huang, & Zeng, 2015; Wen, Zeng, & Huang, 2014). Over
the past decades, synchronization of large-scale complex networks
consisting of coupling dynamical systems has been extensively
investigated in various disciplines Huang, Ho, and Cao (2005) and
Lu and Chen (2006) (Arenas et al., 2008; Strogatz & Stewart, 1993;
Tang et al., 2012; Wu, 2007).
As a special class of complex networks, coupled neural networks have been a hot topic because they have wide applications
in a variety of areas. One of the focus topics in the investigation of
neural networks is the synchronization of all dynamical nodes in a
network, resulting from its important applications such as in image processing, general neural networks, secured communication
and network updating. Meanwhile, many control methodology has
been developed in order to synchronize neural networks governed
by nonlinear systems, such as adaptive control (Zhang & Chen,
2009), fuzzy control (Gao, Feng, & Xi, 2014), impulsive control (Li,
Li, & Liao, 2011; Li & Song, 2013; Yang, Cao, & Lu, 2011; Zhang, Tang,
Miao, & Du, 2013) and intermittent control (Hu, Yu, & Jiang, 2010).
Intermittent control, which was first introduced to control the
nonlinear dynamical systems in Zochowski (2000), has been used
for a variety of purposes such as manufacturing, transportational
and communication. In the past, the intermittent control was
mainly periodically intermittent control (Cai, Liu, Xu, & Shen, 2009;
Wang, Feng, Xu, & Zhao, 2013; Xia & Cao, 2009; Yu, Hu, Jiang, &
Teng, 2012). In Cai et al. (2009), periodically intermittent control is
used for the neural networks with time-varying delays to a desired

orbit. In Yu et al. (2012), the authors have discussed the exponential lay synchronization for delayed fuzzy cellular neural networks
via periodically intermittent control. Meanwhile, uncertainties always exist in the real applications, such as stochastic forces on
the physical systems and noisy measurements caused by environment complexity. For instance, signals transmitted between nodes
of neural networks are unavoidably subject to stochastic perturbations from environment, which may cause information contained
in these signals being lost. Therefore, stochastic perturbations cannot be ignored in general (Huang, Feng, & Cao, 2008; Lu, Ho, &
Cao, 2008; Pototsky & Janson, 2009; Wang et al., 2013; Yang &
Cao, 2009). In Wang et al. (2013), the exponential synchronization
of stochastic perturbed complex networks with time-varying delays via periodically intermittent pinning was studied. In Yang and
Cao (2009), stochastic synchronization of coupled neural networks
with intermittent control was also investigated.
The requirement of periodicity of intermittent control strategy
may not be suitable in reality. For example, the generation of wind
power in smart grid relies on the various situations of our real
world, which is obviously aperiodically intermittent. Therefore, for
the theoretical analysis of real applications, it is more practical to
consider the synchronization problem under aperiodically intermittent control strategy. To the best of our knowledge, there have
been few results for the study of dynamical behaviors in terms of
aperiodically intermittent control strategy. In Liu and Chen (2015),
synchronization of nonlinear coupled networks via aperiodically
intermittent pinning control was investigated. In this paper, we
will study the synchronization of nonlinear coupled complex networks with stochastic perturbation via aperiodically intermittent
control.
Motivated by above discussions, in this paper, we will investigate the problem of synchronization of neural networks
with stochastic perturbation via aperiodically intermittent control.
Firstly, we will establish sufficient conditions for nonlinear coupled
networks under aperiodically intermittent control to achieve synchronization. Secondly, by virtue of properties of Weiner process
and estimation techniques, suitable aperiodically intermittent and
adaptive aperiodically intermittent controllers are designed to ensure stochastic synchronization for the coupled complex networks
with stochastic perturbations. Synchronization criteria obtained in
the paper are simple and verifiable, and hence it is practically useful in applications. The obtained theoretical results will be illustrated by numerical simulations in last section.
The structure of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2,
we will introduce the neural network model with stochastic perturbation in terms of aperiodically intermittent control as well as
some notations. Sufficient synchronization conditions with mathematical justifications are presented in Section 3. Two illustrative
example are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in Section 4. The paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 5.
Notations. The following notations will be used throughout this
paper. λmax (·) stands for the maximum eigenvalue of a real matrix.
R+ and Rn represent, respectively, the set of nonnegative real
numbers and the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Rn×n is used for
the set of all n × n real matrices. ∥ · ∥ is the standard Euclidean
norm in Rn . A = (aij )n×n stands for an n × n matrix with entries aij .
The superscript T denotes the transpose of a matrix or a vector. In
is the n × n identity matrix.

where xi (t ) = (xi1 (t ), xi2 (t ), . . . , xin (t ))T ∈ Rn represents the
state vector of the ith node of the network; C = diag(c1 , c2 , . . . , cn )
with ck > 0, k = 1, 2, . . . , n, denotes the rate with
which the kth cell rests its potential to the resting state when
isolated from other cells and inputs; B = [bij ]n×n ∈ Rn×n
represent the connection weight matrix; A = [aij ]n×n ∈ RN ×N ;
f (xi (t )) = [f1 (xi (t )), f2 (xi (t )), . . . , fn (xi (t ))]T is a continuous

vector-form Weiner process, satisfying E ωj (t ) = 0, E ωi2 = 1,
E ωj (t )ωj (s) = 0(s ̸= t ).
In the case that system (1) reaches synchronization, i.e. x1 (t ) =
x2 (t ) = · · · = xN (t ) = s(t ), by introducing a controller into each
individual node, where s(t ) ∈ R is defined as
s˙(t ) = [−Cs(t ) + Bf (s(t ))]dt + σ (s(t ))dω(t )

(2)

and s(t ) can be set to be any desired state: either equilibrium point,
or a nontrivial periodic orbit, or even a chaotic orbit.
In order to achieve the synchronization objective, the aperiodically intermittent controllers will be applied to some of its nodes.
For the convenience of description, we denote φ(xj (t ), xi (t )) =
φj (xj (t )) − φi (xi (t )). Thus the intermittent controlled network can
be formulated as

where εi > 0 represents control gain and Ξ = diag(ε1 , ε2 , . . . , εN )
∈ Rn×n . The synchronization error is defined to be ei (t ) = xi (t ) −

Define W (t ) = W (t , e(t )) = eγ t V (t ), where γ is the small
positive constant. For t ∈ [ti , si ), we calculate the operator

LW (t , e(t )) = eγ t [γ V (t ) + LV (t )] ≤ eγ t [γ V (t ) + ρ1 V (t )]. (43)

When si − ti = θ and ti+1 − si = ω, the control is periodically
intermittent. We have the following result.
Corollary 2. Suppose Assumptions 1–3 hold. If there exists a positive
constant ϕ such that

ρ1 θ + ρ2 ω < 0

(54)

where ρ1 , and ρ2 are defined in the Theorem 2, then, the
synchronization of the nonlinear coupled neural network with
stochastic perturbation via periodically intermittent control (3) can
be realized.

4. Numerical example
In this section, we provide numerical simulations of two
examples to demonstrate the main results obtained in previous
section.
Example 1. Consider the following neural networks:

x˙ i (t ) =

−Cxi (t ) + Bf (xi (t ))

x˙ i (t ) =
100×100

Choose P = diag(1, 1), and Ξ = diag(3, 3), and we have α =
3.5, ϕ = 1. Let the aperiodically intermittent control parameters
be θ = 0.1 and ω = 0.6. Through a direct computation, we have
a1 = −16.49 and a2 = 4.51. Thus, as t → +∞, one can see


[a1 ik=0 (sk − tk ) + a2 ik=0 (tk − sk )] = −∞. Therefore the error
dynamics of the neural networks (55) can be stabilized and it is
consistent with the result of Theorem 1.
Fig. 1 depicts the trajectories of error states of (55) without
aperiodically intermittent, which indicates that the network
(55) without aperiodically intermittent cannot synchronize itself.
Fig. 2 shows the trajectories of error states of the system
with aperiodically intermittent, which approach to zero as
time increases. Hence the network is synchronized under the
synchronizing aperiodically intermittent control.

N = 100. The other parameters are the same as those given in
Example 1.

2,

By a simple computation, we have ρ1 = −19.54 and ρ2 = 2.51.
Similar to Example 1, one can see that the error dynamics of
this neural networks (55) is asymptotically stable, as predicted
by Theorem 2. Figs. 3 and 4 show the synchronization errors of
x11 − xi1 and x12 − xi2 , respectively. These figures indicate that
synchronization can be achieved.
5. Conclusions
Periodically intermittent control for neural networks may
not be realistic in many real applications, in particular, when

uncertainties are taken into the consideration. In this paper, we
study the synchronization problem for neural networks with
stochastic perturbation via aperiodically intermittent control as
well as adaptive aperiodically intermittent control. Under the
framework of stochastic theory and Lyapunov stability method,
sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the synchronization
by making use of the adaptive aperiodicity intermittent control
technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Our next goal is to investigate the
synchronization for neural networks with time-varying delays via
aperiodically intermittent control, and the results will be reported
elsewhere.

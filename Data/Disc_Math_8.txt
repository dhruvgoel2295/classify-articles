abstract
In this paper, I present a new structural lemma for k-regular graphs, similar to an earlier
lemma by Lovász (1975) [5]. The new lemma is then used to give an algebraic proof of
Brooks’ theorem for list-colouring.

1. Introduction
Brooks’ classical theorem [3] says that if a simple finite graph has maximal degree k, where k is at least 3, and no
component of it is a Kk+1 , then it can be properly coloured using k colours. Many interesting proofs have been found for this
theorem, and in 1973, Lovász, [5] gave a very nice proof. There he proved a lemma, dealing with a finite, simple, connected
graph G. It says that if G is not complete and has no cut-vertex, then there is a vertex triple p, q, r with a nice property:
pq ∈ E , pr ∈ E , qr ̸∈ E and G − q − r is connected.
He then considered a minimal counterexample to Brooks’ theorem. It must clearly satisfy the conditions of the lemma;
hence, there are vertices p, q and r as described. The colouring can then be done as follows. First, one orders V \ {q, r } as
v1 , . . . , vn−2 in such a way that d(vi , p) ≤ d(vi+1 , p) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3. Here d denotes the usual distance in the connected
graph G − q − r. One then puts q = vn−1 , r = vn .
One starts by giving q and r the same colour. Having coloured vi+1 , we colour vi , which is feasible, since vi has at least
one neighbour vj with j < i and thus has not been coloured yet. This fails for i = 1, but as q and r have the same colour,
there is still at least one colour available for v1 = p.
This proof does not immediately apply to list-colouring. Here each vertex v comes with a list Lv of k legal colours for v . One
must choose a colour cv from Lv , for each v , so that uv ∈ E ⇒ cu ̸= cv . Consider now a vertex-minimal counterexample G
having a cut-vertex v . By minimality, each component of G − v has a colouring extendable to v , but it may not be possible
to choose these extended colourings such that they together form a colouring of G. Thus one cannot assume, as Lovász does,
that G has no cut-vertex. In Section 2, it is shown how to deal with the case when there are cut-vertices.
In Section 3, I shall prove another, similar, lemma, which works for list-colouring. That lemma will be applied in an
algebraic proof of Brooks’ theorem for list-colouring, in Section 4. Section 5 contains historical remarks.
2. A folklore argument (provided by a referee)
The following argument shows that the Lovász proof extends to the list-colouring case, as it shows how to deal with
cut-vertices. We consider a minimal counterexample G to Brooks’ theorem for which its vertices p, q, r do not exist; hence,

G has a cut-vertex b. We assume b to be chosen from an endblock B, so that b is the only vertex common to B and U, where
U is the union of the other blocks of G.
By the minimality of G, it follows that U can be properly coloured, say with colour x of b. By the lemma p, q and r exist
for B. If b ̸∈ {q, r }, then p, q, r also works for G, so we may assume that q = b. We also have by minimality that G is regular.
If now Lp ̸= Lr , then r can be given a colour from Lr \ Lp , and then Lovász’ procedure will work. Hence we assume Lp = Lr .
If x ∈ Lp , then x ∈ Lr . Using x for r, the procedure works again. If x ̸∈ Lp , then any colour from Lr can be given to r, and once
again the procedure works.
Since G can be assumed to be without cut-vertices, the reader can now go directly to Section 4 for the algebraic proof. In
Section 3 I prove the structure lemma I at first thought necessary for the algebraic proof, as it may still have some interest
in itself.
3. A Lovász-type lemma
In this section we prove the following
Lemma. Fix k > 2. If G is a finite, simple, k-regular, connected graph other than Kk+1 , then G has 3 vertices, p, q and r such that
pq ∈ E (G), pr ∈ E (G), qr ̸∈ E (G) and in addition
(1) G − q − r is connected, or
(2) G − q − r consists of two components Pp and D where p ∈ Pp , while D is a Kk−1 , each vertex of which is a neighbour (in G) of
q and r.
Proof. Each vertex p has neighbours q and r such that qr ̸∈ E. We choose a triple (p, q, r ) for which Pp , the component of
G − q − r containing p, has the most of vertices. Assume now that (1) is not satisfied. Let D be any of the other components
of G − q − r. Since G is connected, we may assume that at least one of q and r, say q, has a neighbour in D. Put D−1 = ∅,
D0 = {q}, and let Di = {v : v ∈ D ∪ {r } & d(v, q) = i}, for i = 1, . . .. Here d denotes the usual distance, calculated in the
graph induced by G on {q, r } ∪ V (D) if r has a neighbour in D, but on {q} ∪ V (D) if not. In the latter case r is not in any Di .
Let I be the largest i for which Di is non-empty.
We first prove by induction on i that Di ∪ Di+1 is a clique in G, for i ∈ {−1, 0, . . . , I − 1}. The claim is trivial when i = −1.
We now consider i ≥ 0 and do the induction step from i − 1 to i. Put, for convenience, Di = {i′ , i′′ , . . .}. Since Di−1 ∪ Di is a
clique, Di is one, too. If Di ∪ Di+1 is not a clique there exist i′ and (i + 1)′ such that i′ (i + 1)′ ̸∈ E or (i + 1)′ and (i + 1)′′ such
that (i + 1)′ (i + 1)′′ ̸∈ E. In the first case there is an edge i′′ (i + 1)′ . Choosing the triple (i′′ , i′ , (i + 1)′ ) instead of (p, q, r )
we find that Pi′′ ⊃ Pp ∪ D0 ∪ · · · ∪ Di \ {i′ }, a contradiction to the maximality of V (Pp ). In the second case, there exists an
i′ with i′ (i + 1)′ ̸∈ E and, by what we just proved, i′ (i + 1)′′ ∈ E. Replacing (p, q, r ) by (i′ , (i + 1)′ , (i + 1)′′ ), we find that
Pi′ ⊃ Pp ∪ D0 ∪ · · · ∪ Di+1 \ {(i + 1)′ , (i + 1)′′ }, which is a contradiction again. Hence Di ∪ Di+1 is a clique.
Consider now the clique DI −1 ∪ DI . If DI contains some I ′ other than r, then |DI −1 ∪ DI | = k + 1, as DI −1 ∪ DI consists of
I ′ and its neighbours in G. Since G contains no (k + 1)-clique we have DI = {r } and I > 1. Choose a vertex 1′ from D1 . Now
D0 ∪ D1 ∪ D2 consists of 1′ and its neighbours in G, and so |D1 ∪ D2 | = k. If |D2 | > 1, then D2 = {2′ , 2′′ , . . .}, and we can
replace (p, q, r ) by (1′ , q, 2′ ). Since now P1′ ⊃ D1 ∪ D2 \ {2′ } ∪ D3 ∪ · · · ∪ DI ∪ Pp , we conclude that |D2 | = 1 and |D1 | = k − 1.
Now D2 = {2′ }, but 2′ = r. For if not, 2′ has just one neighbour, 3′ , outside D1 and we can replace (p, q, r ) by (2′ , 1′ , 3′ ).
Now P2′ ⊃ D1 \ {1′ } ∪ {q} ∪ Pp , a contradiction. Thus D2 = {r } and I = 2, while each of the k − 1 vertices of D = D1 is a
neighbour of q and r. Hence we have (2).
Corollary. If the G in the Lemma is a minimal counterexample to Brooks’ theorem for list-colouring, then G − q − r is connected.
Proof. Since G is a minimal counterexample, it satisfies the conditions of the lemma. In case (2) of the lemma, p is clearly a
cut-vertex of G but, as shown in Section 2, G has no cut-vertices. Hence we have case (1).
Remark. Since the component D in case (2) is so simple, the corollary can also be proved without recourse to Section 2.
4. Algebraic proof of Brooks’ theorem for list-colouring
From the corollary in Section 3 (or from Section 2) we know that a vertex-minimal counterexample G to the theorem
must have vertices p, q, r such that pq ∈ E (G), pr ∈ E (G), qr ̸∈ E (G) while G − q − r is connected. We number the vertices
of G in the way that was described in Section 1 and introduce the polynomial P (x1 , . . . , xn ) = Π (xi − xj ), where each factor
has i < j and corresponds to an edge vi vj of G.
We may clearly assume that the list Li assigned to vi is given by the set of zeros of a complex polynomial fi defined as
e
xk − gi (x), with deg(gi ) < k. We may also assume that g1 (x) = 1. Write P as a sum of terms ae1 ...en x11 . . . xenn and replace in
ei
∗
each term each power xi for which ei = k by gi (xi ). The result is a polynomial P of degree < k in each variable. It follows
easily from Alon’s Combinatorial Nullstellensatz that P ∗ = 0. It therefore suffices for us to obtain a contradiction by finding
a nonzero coefficient in P ∗ .
Among the 2m monomials obtained by multiplying out P , M, the monomial obtained by choosing xi from each factor
e
stands out. It equals x11 . . . xenn , where e1 = k, e2 , . . . , en−2 are less than k, and en−1 = en = 0. It is easily seen that none of
the other monomials equals ±M. Let M ∗ be the contribution to P ∗ from M. Since gi (x) = 1 and e2 , . . . , en−2 are all less than
e
e
k, while en−1 = en = 0, M ∗ = x22 · · · xnn−−22 .

P contains 2m − 1 other monomials (before collection of terms); let M0 be any one of them, of the form ±x11 · · · xdnn . Let
M0 denote the contribution to P ∗ from M0 . Then M0∗ = ±h1 (x1 ) · · · hn (xn ), where hi (x) = xdi if di < k, while hi (x) = gi (x)
(as defined above) if di = k. M0∗ becomes a sum of monomials when multiplied out, and we shall see below that none of
e
e
e
e
these have the form ax22 · · · xnn−−22 . From this it follows that P ∗ , when written in standard form, equals · · · + x22 · · · xnn−−22 + · · ·
and is not the zero polynomial, which gives the desired contradiction.
e
e
Assume now that some monomial from M0∗ actually equals x22 · · · xnn−−22 . Since d1 +· · ·+ dn = e1 +· · · en−2 and M0 ̸= ±M,
as seen above, di < ei for some i. Now i = 1, as otherwise xi appears only to the di th power in each term of M0∗ . Since
∗

d

i = 1, we have d1 = 0, for d1 < e1 = k, so that if d1 was positive, then x11 would divide each term of M0∗ , but not
M ∗ . But since d1 = 0, dn−1 and dn are both positive, as vn−1 and vn are neighbours of v1 . Then dn = k, as otherwise
c
xdnn divides each term of M0∗ and similarly dn−1 = k. Each term of M0∗ as multiplied out has the form bx11 . . . xcnn . Here
c1 + · · · + cn−2 d1 + · · · dn−2 = m − 2k, and the special term we are looking at has cn−1 = cn = 0. Thus the special term
has degree at most m − 2k, while deg(M ∗ ) = m − k. This contradiction shows that P ∗ ̸= 0.
5. Historical remarks and a question
This paper was inspired by an early version of [4], which gives a different algebraic proof of Brooks’ theorem for listcolouring. However, its roots go back more than 50 years. In the late 1950’s I tried to solve the 4-colour problem by an
algebraic method that, when extended, becomes the celebrated Combinatorial Nullstellensatz by Alon, cf. [1]. The attempt
was abortive, and so I did not publish anything about the method. In 1968, however, H. Bergmann published [2], containing
essentially the same method, but with no applications. His paper seems to have gone unnoticed.
In 1971 I found an application for my method to Brooks’ theorem, but I first had to prove a purely graph-theoretic lemma.
When I realized that the lemma also gave a non-algebraic proof, I hesitated to publish. Then, in 1975, Lovász [5] proved the
same lemma and applied it to a non-algebraic proof. Finally, in 1980, I submitted a manuscript [6], containing among other
things also my algebraic proof. Unfortunately, [6] was not accepted, so it was only later, and in particular after publication
of [1], that the force of algebra was demonstrated.
Upon seeing [4], it was natural to see whether my old algebraic approach would work also for the list version of Brooks’
theorem. It was clear that now Alon’s theorem would have to be used, and it seemed then that a different Lovász-type lemma
had to be used. The rest was easy.
Returning to the 4-colour theorem: I can now see why my approach did not work. I focused on those of the monomials of
P (x1 , . . . , xn ) where each xi occurs to at most the third power, since they go unchanged into P ∗ . But if a nonzero term of P ∗
could be found in that way, one would in fact have found a proof of the 4-colour theorem for list-colouring, which is known
to be false.
There is a general wish for a better proof of the 4-colour theorem. While waiting for that, I think that having various
proofs of graph colouring theorems should be encouraged; somewhere an idea applicable to the 4CT might turn up!
The question: A problem came to my mind during the work on this paper. Given the colourlist for a graph G satisfying
Brooks’ conditions, and a vertex v of G. Choose a colour for v . Can that colouring be extended to all of G?

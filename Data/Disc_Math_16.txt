abstract
Let G be a finite simple graph. Let S ⊆ V (G), its closed interval I [S ] is the set of all vertices
lying on shortest paths between any pair of vertices of S. The set S is convex if I [S ] = S. In
this work we define the concept of a convex partition of graphs. If there exists a partition of
V (G) into p convex sets we say that G is p-convex. We prove that it is NP-complete to decide
whether a graph G is p-convex for a fixed integer p ≥ 2. We show that every connected
chordal graph is p-convex, for 1 ≤ p ≤ n. We also establish conditions on n and k to decide
if the k-th power of a cycle Cn is p-convex. Finally, we develop a linear-time algorithm to
decide if a cograph is p-convex.

1. Introduction
In recent years, many papers have appeared which, in some sense, extend concepts and methods from continuous
mathematics to graph theory. The concept of convex sets is one of these topics of interest. The analogy between the concept
of a convex set in continuous and discrete mathematics can be made by considering the vertex set of a connected graph and
the distance between two vertices (number of edges in the shortest path between them) as a metric space. Thus, a vertex
subset S of V (G) is said to be convex if it contains the vertices of all shortest paths connecting any pair of vertices in S. Other
definitions of convexity have been studied just by considering different path types such as chordless paths [14,18,19] or
triangle paths [7].
Some of the early articles that generalized the Euclidean concepts of convex sets to graph theory are [8,9,16–18,21]. But,
convexity in graphs was also studied under different aspects like geodetic sets, geodetic, hull and convexity numbers [4,12,
13,15].
The concept of a convex p-partition in a graph was defined in [1], as a partition of the vertex set of a graph into p convex
sets. If G has a convex p-partition, then G is p-convex. In this paper we show that it is NP-complete to decide if a graph
is p-convex, for a fixed p ≥ 2. So, a natural question is to study the complexity of determining if a graph is p-convex for
different classes of graphs.

In the work [3], the authors have studied the class of powers of chordal graphs. The class of powers of cycles has been
studied on the domain of total coloring by [6], and its coloring by [5,23]. Characterization and recognition problems were
developed in [20,22].
In this paper, we prove that all chordal graphs are p-convex for any value of p. We show that it can be verified in lineartime if a cograph is p-convex for any value of p. For the class of powers of cycles we determine the cases where the graph
is biconvex. Also, we prove that any power of a cycle is p-convex, for p ≥ 3. Finally, we examine convex p-partitions of
disconnected graphs.
2. Preliminaries
In this work, we denote by G a simple graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E (G), where |V (G)| = n and |E (G)| = m.
Let S ⊆ V (G). We say that G[S ] is the subgraph of G induced by S. We denote by G the complement of the graph G.
A geodesic between v and w in G is a minimum path between v and w in
the graph. The closed interval I [v, w] is the set
of all vertices lying on a geodesic between v and w . Given a set S , I [S ] = u,v∈S I [u, v]. If I [S ] = S, then S is a convex set.
The convex hull of S, denoted Ih [S ], is the smallest convex set containing S. If Ih [S ] = V , then S is a hull set.
The length of a path P between two vertices v and w , denoted by |P |, is the number of edges in P . The distance in G
between v and w , denoted by dG (v, w), is the length of a geodesic between v and w in G.
We define NG (v) = {w ∈ V |dG (v, w) = 1} and NG [v] = {w ∈ V |dG (v, w) ≤ 1}. Generalizing this concept, if S ⊆ V , then
NG (S ) = {w ∈ V \ S |dG (v, w) = 1, ∀v ∈ S } and NG [S ] = {w ∈ V |dG (v, w) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ S }.
A set S ⊆ V (G) is an independent set if no two vertices of S are adjacent in G. A set K ⊆ V (G) is a clique if every two
vertices of S are adjacent in G.
We say that v ∈ V (G) is a simplicial vertex of G if NG (v) is a clique. We say that v ∈ V (G) is a universal vertex of G if
NG [v] = V .
A graph Cn is a cycle, with length n, if it is a finite sequence v0 , v1 , . . . , vn of vertices, n ≥ 3, such that {vi−1 , vi } ∈
E (Cn ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n and v0 = vn .
A graph G is p-colorable if there exists an assignment of p colors, to the vertices of V (G), such that no two distinct adjacent
vertices have the same color. The chromatic number of G, χ (G), is the minimum p for which G is p-colorable. See [2].
Let V = (V1 , . . . , Vp ), 1 ≤ p ≤ n, be a partition of V (G). If V contains only cliques we say that V is a clique partition
of V (G). Denote by Θ (G) the minimum size of a clique partition of V (G). If V contains at most one non-clique, then V is a
quasi-clique partition of V (G). If V contains only convex sets, then V is a convex partition of V (G). Finally, if V contains only
convex sets and is a quasi-clique partition then we say that V is a quasi-clique convex partition of V (G). The latter concept
appears naturally in the study of the convex partitions of cographs.
Given a graph G, a convex p-partition of V (G) is a convex partition of V (G) into p sets. Clearly, every graph is 1-convex.
So, we consider p ≥ 2. We say that G is p-convex if V (G) has a convex p-partition. In particular, if p = 2, then V (G) has a
convex bipartition and G is biconvex.
The convex partition number of a graph G, Θc (G), is the least integer p ≥ 2 for which G is p-convex. Denote by Θc′ (G) the
minimum integer p ≥ 2 for which G has a quasi-clique convex p-partition. A graph G is strong p-convex if G is p-convex and
every convex p-partition of G is a quasi-clique partition. Denote by Θc′′ (G) the minimum integer p ≥ 2 for which G is strong
p-convex.
It is clear that, for any graph G, we have Θc (G) ≤ Θc′ (G) ≤ Θc′′ (G) ≤ |V (G)|. An example where the equality holds is the
complete bipartite graph, that is, Θc (G) = Θc′ (G) = Θc′′ (G) = q, for G = Kq,q . We also have Θc (G) ≤ Θc′ (G) ≤ Θ (G) ≤
|V (G)|.
3. NP-completeness
In this section we discuss the complexity of the convex p-partition problem, i.e., the problem of deciding if a graph has
a convex p-partition for a fixed p, 2 ≤ p ≤ n.
convex p-partition
Instance: Graph G.
Question: Can V (G) be partitioned into p disjoint convex sets?
The clique p-partition problem is defined as follows:
clique p-partition
Instance: Graph G.
Question: Can V (G) be partitioned into p disjoint cliques?
Note that, unlike the clique p-partition problem, the fact that G is p-convex does not imply that G is (p + 1)-convex,
for p < |V (G)|. For example, Fig. 1(a) and (b) show a convex 2-partition and a convex 4-partition of a graph. However, this
graph has no convex 3-partition.
Observation 1. A clique K of a graph G is a convex set of G, consequently every clique partition of V (G) is a convex partition
of G.

Observation 2. If G is a p-colorable graph, for p ≥ 2, then G is p-convex. Furthermore, there is a convex partition of V (G)
formed by p cliques.
Now we prove that deciding whether a graph is p-convex, for a fixed p ≥ 3, is NP-complete.
Theorem 3. The convex p-partition problem is NP-complete, for a fixed p ≥ 3.
Proof. The problem is in NP because verifying if a subset of V (G) is convex can be done in polynomial-time [12]. The hardness
proof is a reduction from the clique p-partition problem. Without loss of generality, let G be a graph with |V (G)| ≥ 2,
such that V (G) is not a clique. Let G′ be the graph obtained from G by adding two non-adjacent vertices u and v with
N (u) = N (v) = V (G).
First, we show that any proper convex set of G′ is a clique. Suppose that C is a proper convex set of G′ which is not a
clique. In this case, u, v ∈ C . But, since I [u, v] = V (G′ ), we have that C = V (G′ ), a contradiction.
If V (G) has a partition V into p cliques, p ≥ 3, then we can form a convex p-partition V ′ of V (G′ ) adding u, v in different
sets of V .
Conversely, a convex p-partition V ′ of V (G′ ), p ≥ 3, induces a partition of V (G) into ℓ cliques, where p − 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ p. If
ℓ ̸= p, we divide a clique of V ′ into two cliques in order to obtain a partition of V (G) into ℓ + 1 cliques. If ℓ + 1 ̸= p, then
we repeat this argument until obtaining a clique p-partition of V (G).
Since a clique 2-partition could be decided in polynomial-time, the above reduction is not valid when p = 2. The
complexity of this case is proved by reducing the NP-complete 1-in-3 3 sat problem to a convex 2-partition problem.
1-in-3 3 sat
Instance: Set X = {x1 , . . . , xn } of variables, collection C = {c1 , . . . , cm } of clauses over X such that each clause c ∈ C has
|c | = 3 and no negative literals.
Question: Is there a truth assignment for X such that each clause in C has exactly one true literal?
We say that C is satisfiable if there exists a truth assignment for X such that C is satisfiable and each clause in C has
exactly one true variable.
Theorem 4. The convex 2-partition problem is NP-complete.
Proof. The problem is in NP, again, because verifying if a set is convex can be done in polynomial-time [12]. In order to
reduce 1-in-3 3 sat to a convex 2-partition we construct a particular instance G of a convex 2-partition from a generic
instance (X , C ) of 1-in-3 3 sat, such that C is satisfiable if and only if G is biconvex. First we describe the construction of a
particular instance G of convex 2-partition; second we prove in Lemma 5 that a convex 2-partition of V (G) defines a truth
assignment that satisfies (X , C ); third we prove in Lemma 6 that a truth assignment that satisfies (X , C ) defines a graph G
which is biconvex. These steps are explained in detail below.
The construction of a particular instance of a convex 2-partition problem.
The vertex set V (G) contains: for every variable xi ∈ X , one vertex xi in G; for every clause cj in C eleven vertices:
fj , l1j , l2j , l3j , ℓ1j , ℓ2j , ℓ3j , q1j , q2j , q3j , tj ; and two auxiliary vertices: f and t.
We denote by F = {fj |1 ≤ j ≤ m}, L = {lij |1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3}, X = {x1 , . . . , xn }, Q = {qij |1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ i ≤

3}, L = {ℓij |1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3} and T = {tj |1 ≤ j ≤ m}.
The edge set E (G) is such that: X∪Q is a clique; f is a universal vertex to F ∪X∪Q , and t is universal to X∪Q ∪T ; moreover,
for every clause cj = {xb , xc , xd }, we add the edges {l1j , xb }, {l2j , xc }, {l3j , xd }, {fj , l1j }, {fj , l2j }, {fj , l3j }, {tj , ℓ1j }, {tj , ℓ2j }, {tj , ℓ3j },

{q1j , ℓ1j }, {q2j , ℓ2j }, {q3j , ℓ3j } and {l1j , ℓ2j }, {l1j , ℓ3j }, {l2j , ℓ1j }, {l2j , ℓ3j }, {l3j , ℓ1j }, {l3j , ℓ2j }. The construction of G is finished.

Lemmas 5 and 6 prove the required equivalence for establishing Theorem 4. We exhibit in Fig. 2 an example of a particular
instance (X , C ) = ({x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 }, {(x1 , x2 , x3 ), (x3 , x4 , x5 )}).

Fig. 2. The graph G for the instance (X , C ) = ({x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 }, {(x1 , x2 , x3 ), (x3 , x4 , x5 )}). We omit all edges between L and L. The rectangle represents
a clique, white vertices belong to Vt and black vertices belong to Vf . White vertices of X represent the variables of X set to true.

Lemma 5. If G is biconvex, then C is satisfiable.
Proof. Let V = (Vf , Vt ) be a convex bipartition of V (G). First, we claim that f and t do not belong to the same set of V .
Suppose that f , t ∈ Vf , then X ∪ Q ⊆ Vf . Let v, w be two vertices of F ∪ L ∪ L ∪ T generated by distinct clauses of C . The
vertices v and w do not belong to Vt since I [v, w] ∩ Vf ̸= ∅. Hence, Vt is formed by at most eight vertices, the vertices of
S = {fj , l1j , l2j , l3j , ℓ1j , ℓ2j , ℓ3j , tj } generated by a unique clause cj of C . Observe that S is not a convex set, because there exists a
geodesic between l1j and ℓ1j that uses vertices of X ∪ Q . Hence Vt ⊂ S. It is easy to see that, if one vertex of S ′ = {fj , l1j , l2j , l3j }
belongs to Vf , then all vertices of S ′ belong to Vf . Therefore, we conclude that either Vt = S ′ or Vt = S \ S ′ . Without loss
of generality, suppose that Vt = S ′ . Since ℓ3j ∈ I [l1j , l2j ], Vt is not a convex set. Hence, V is not a convex bipartition and we
conclude that f and t belong to distinct sets of V . Let f ∈ Vf and t ∈ Vt .
Since f ∈ I [fj , t ], then fj ∈ Vf for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m. Analogously, tj ∈ Vt for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
Now we prove that V defines a satisfiable truth assignment for (X , C ). First, we observe that if vertex xi belongs to Vf ,
then NG[L∪xi ] (xi ) ⊆ Vf . Let v ∈ NG[L∪xi ] (xi ), this property holds because there exists a geodesic between v and t using xi .
Analogously, if vertex xi belongs to Vt , then NG[L∪xi ] (xi ) ⊆ Vt . Consequently, we could associate the set X with X and L with
C and V would represent a truth assignment for the set of variables, where the variable xi is true if and only if the vertex
xi ∈ Vt . We refer to Fig. 2, where white vertices belong to Vt and black vertices belong to Vf . It remains to prove that for each
set Lj = {l1j , l2j , l3j }, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, exactly one of the vertices belongs to Vt . If at least two vertices v, w of Lj belong to Vt , then
fj ∈ I [v, w], which is a contradiction. If Lj ⊆ Vf , then {ℓ1j , ℓ2j , ℓ3j } ⊆ Vf , and consequently tj ∈ Vf , which is a contradiction.
This concludes the proof.
The converse of Lemma 5 is given next by Lemma 6.
Lemma 6. If C is satisfiable, then G is biconvex.
Proof. Suppose that there exists a truth assignment which satisfies (X , C ). We construct a bipartition (Vf , Vt ) of V (G) as
follows. First add to Vt the vertices t , t1 , . . . , tm , the vertices xi and lij ∈ NG[L∪xi ] (xi ) such that the variable xi is true; and the
vertices qij , ℓij such that lij has not been added to Vt , for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Define Vf = V (G) \ Vt . We complete the
proof showing that Vf and Vt are convex sets.
Fact 1. Vertex lij ∈ Vf if and only if NG[X∪li ] (lij ) ∈ Vf , for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ i ≤ 3.
j

Fact 2. Vertex lij ∈ Vf if and only if ℓij ∈ Vt , for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ i ≤ 3.
Fact 3. Vertex lij ∈ Vf if and only if qij ∈ Vt , for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ i ≤ 3.
Fact 4. For all lij ∈ L, if lij ∈ Vf , then NG (lij ) ⊆ Vf . Hence, if for some w ∈ Vf I [lij , w] ̸⊆ Vf , then there exists a vertex v ∈ NG (lij )
such that I [v, w] ̸⊆ Vf .
We prove that Vf is convex by showing that there does not exist a vertex in Vt lying in a geodesic between two nonadjacent vertices v, w ∈ Vf . Consider the following cases:
Let v = f . Case w ∈ L: by Fact 4 we do not need to analyze this case. Case w ∈ L: d(v, w) = 2 using a vertex z of Q and
by Fact 3, z ∈ Vf . Let v ∈ F . Case w ∈ F : trivial. Case w ∈ L: Fact 4. Case w ∈ X ∪ Q : trivial. Case w ∈ L: let P be a geodesic

between v and w . If |P | = 2, then V (P ) ⊆ Vf by Fact 2; if |P | = 3, then V (P ) ⊆ Vf by Fact 3. Let v ∈ L. By Fact 4 it is not
necessary to analyze this case. Let v ∈ X ∪ Q ∪ L, trivial.
The argument to prove that Vt is convex is analogous. Hence, we conclude that if C is satisfiable, then V (G) has a convex
bipartition.
4. Chordal graphs
In this section, we examine convex partitions of chordal graphs. A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least 4 has
a chord.
Theorem 7. If G is a connected chordal graph, then G is p-convex for all 1 ≤ p ≤ n.
Proof. Since G is chordal it admits a perfect elimination ordering L of its set of vertices V (G). We will prove that, given p, if
we divide V (G) into p sets, where p − 1 are unitary sets containing the first p − 1 vertices of L, and the other set S is formed
by the remaining vertices of V (G), this partition is a convex p-partition of V (G). Clearly, the unitary sets are convex, we just
need to prove that S is convex.
Suppose that S is not a convex set. Therefore, there exists a geodesic P between two vertices u, v of S using vertices
outside S. Let P = w0 , w1 , . . . , wd−1 , wd , where w0 = u and wd = v . Let wq be the first vertex of L which belongs to P , for
some 1 ≤ q ≤ d − 1. Since G is chordal, we know that wq is a simplicial vertex in the graph induced by wq and all vertices
greater than wq in L. Hence wq−1 and wq+1 are adjacent in G. In this case, there exists a path P ′ = u, . . . , wq−1 , wq+1 , . . . , v
shorter than P , a contradiction. Then S is convex.
Corollary 8. If G is a connected chordal graph, then G has a convex quasi-clique p-partition, for all 1 ≤ p ≤ n.
5. Powers of cycles
A power of cycle Cnk , 1 ≤ k ≤ n, is a graph such that V (Cnk ) = V (Cn ) and E (Cnk ) = {{vi , vj }| vi , vj ∈ V (Cnk ) and dCn (vi , vj ) ≤
k}. The reach of an edge {vi , vj } in Cnk is the distance from vi to vj in Cn . Let {u, v} ∈ E (Cnk ), we say that {u, v} is an edge of
maximum reach in Cnk if dCn (u, v) = k. We denote the vertices of Cnk by v0 , . . . , vn , where vi−1 and vi are consecutive in Cn
and vn = v0 , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
The next result states conditions to determine whether Cnk is p-convex, for p ≥ 2.
Theorem 9. Cnk is p-convex if and only if p ≥ 3 or n ≤ 2k + 2 or n ≡ 0, 1, 2 (mod 2k).
Proof. It follows directly from Lemma 13 and Corollaries 11, 15 and 17.
Lemma 10 establishes bounds for p such that Cnk has a partition into p cliques.
Lemma 10. Cnk is p-convex for

Proof. Let {v0 , vk } be an edge of maximum reach in Cnk . The set {v0 , v1 , . . . , vk } is 
a clique
 in Cn . By similarity, every edge of

k
maximum reach in Cn defines a clique of size k + 1. Hence Cn has a partition into k+1 cliques.

Corollary 11. If n ≤ 2k + 2, then Cnk is p-convex, for all 1 ≤ p ≤ n.
Let v, w be a pair of vertices of Cnk and V1 , V2 be the sets of vertices of the two different paths from v to w in Cn . In the
following observation we prove that the geodesics between v and w in Cnk are the geodesics between v and w either in Cnk [V1 ]
or Cnk [V2 ].
Observation 12. Let S = {v1 , v2 , . . . , v|S | } be a subset of V (Cnk ). Then for every geodesic between v1 and v|S | , P (v1 , v|S | ) =
u1 , u2 , . . . , u|P | , where u1 = v1 and u|P | = v|S | either U = {u2 , . . . , u|P |−1 } ⊆ S or U ⊆ (V (Cnk ) \ S ).
Proof. Suppose that there exists a geodesic P (v1 , v|S | ) = u1 , u2 , . . . , u|P | such that U ∩ S ̸= ∅ and U ∩ V (Cnk ) \ S ̸= ∅. Then
there exists a vertex ui , 2 ≤ i ≤ |P | − 1, such that either {u2 , . . . , ui } ⊆ S and ui+1 ∈ V (Cnk ) \ S, or {u2 , . . . , ui } ⊆ V (Cnk ) \ S
and ui+1 ∈ S.
Let {u2 , . . . , ui } ⊆ S and ui+1 ∈ V (Cnk ) \ S. Since ui ∈ S , ui+1 ∈ V (Cnk ) \ S and dCn (ui , ui+1 ) ≤ k, either {v1 , ui } ∈ E (Cnk ) or
{ui , v|S | } ∈ E (Cnk ). Then P is not a geodesic. The case {u2 , . . . , ui } ⊆ V (Cnk ) \ S and ui+1 ∈ S is analogous.
Now we show that all powers of cycles are p-convex for 3 ≤ p <
consecutive vertices of Cn such that each set is formed by at most
convex.

and each Vi contains consecutive vertices of Cn . We assume that k ≤ 3n , otherwise V is a clique partition. Let V1 =
{v1 , . . . , v|V1 | } and vr , vs ∈ V1 be two vertices such that 1 < r < s ≤ |V1 |. We want to show that if a pair of vertices of V1 has
a geodesic using vertices outside V1 , then v1 and v|V1 | also has one. Define U = {vr , vr +1 , . . . , vs }, U ′ = {vs , vs+1 , . . . , vr }
and V1′ = {v|V1 | , v|V1 |+1 , . . . , v1 }. Suppose that there exists a geodesic P (r , s) between r and s such that V (P ) ⊆ U ′ . Since
|V1′ | < |U ′ |, |U | < |V1 | and by Observation 12, we conclude that there exists a geodesic P ′ (v1 , v|V1 | ) such that V (P ′ ) ⊆ V1′ .
Then it is sufficient to show that there does not exist a geodesic between v1 and v|V1 | containing vertices outside V1 .
Suppose that there exist geodesics between u and v, P (u, v) ⊆ Cnk [V1 ] and P ′ (u, v) ⊆ Cnk [(V \ V1 ) ∪ {v1 , v|V1 | }], in Cnk .

Since k ≤ 3n and n − 3n ≥ 2 3n , we have that |P | < |P ′ |. Hence P ′ (u, v) is not a geodesic, a contradiction. It is
clear that a similar argument holds for p > 3.
For the case p = 2 there exist values of n and k such that Cnk is not biconvex.

Proof. Suppose that there exists a non-clique convex set S ⊂ V ( ) such that |S | ≥ 2 . We show that |S | ≥ 2 implies
that S contains a pair of vertices u, w such that Ih [u, w] = V (Cnk ). 

First, we claim that S has a pair of vertices u and w such that 2n − 1 ≤ dCn (u, w) ≤ 2n . We denote a + b (mod n) by

Clearly, |B(S )| = |S |. We analyze two cases: n odd and n even. If n is odd, let D = 2 − 1. Suppose that the claim is false, then
S ∩ B(S ) = ∅. Since n is odd, |S | + |B(S )| > n, which is a contradiction. If n is even, let D = 2n . We define S ′ = {v1 , . . . , vq }
as a maximal subset of consecutive vertices of S in Cn , 1 ≤ q ≤ |S |. Since S ′ is maximal, v0 , vq+1 ̸∈ S, which implies that
vD , vq+1+D ̸∈ B(S ). But vD and vq+1+D have a distance 2n − 1 from v1 and vq , respectively. Suppose that the claim is false.
Analogously to the odd

6. Disconnected graphs
In this section, we describe a method for reducing the problem of deciding whether a disconnected graph admits a convex
p-partition into a similar problem for a connected graph.
Note that if a disconnected graph contains ω connected components then it is trivially p-convex, for any p ≤ ω.
Theorem 18. Let G be a graph with connected components G1 , . . . , Gω . Graph G is p-convex if and only if for each Gi there exists
pi , 1 ≤ i ≤ ω, such that:
(i) G
∑i is pi -convex;
(ii)
1≤i≤ω pi ≥ p, and each pi ≤ p.
Proof. Let V = (V1 , . . . , Vp ) be a convex p-partition of V (G). We define Vi = (V1 ∩ Gi , . . . , Vp ∩ Gi ) by only considering
cases Vj ∩ Gi ̸= ∅, 1 ≤ j ≤ p and 1 ≤ i ≤ ω. Note that Vi is a convex
pi -partition of V (Gi ), where pi ≤ p. Furthermore, since
∑
each set Vj has vertices of one or more partitions Vi , we have 1≤i≤ω pi ≥ p.
∑
Conversely, let Gi be pi -convex, 1 ≤ i ≤ ω, and 1≤i≤ω pi ≥ p. The convex sets which form the convex pi -partitions of
∑
graphs Gi is a convex ℓ-partition of G, where ℓ =
1≤i≤ω pi ≥ p. If ℓ > p, we construct a convex (ℓ − 1)-partition of G
performing the union between a convex set of a connected component Gi and one convex set of Gj , where i ̸= j. We note
that the union of convex sets of distinct connected components is also convex, and the union of convex sets of the same
connected component could not be convex. So, we repeat this process until obtaining partitions with less than ℓ − 1 convex
sets. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, max{pi |1 ≤ i ≤ ω} is the lower bound for the minimum number of sets in a convex
partition obtained in this way. Since each pi ≤ p, with this procedure we have a convex p-partition for G.
Theorem 18 reduces the problem of deciding whether a disconnected graph G, with connected components G1 , . . . , Gω ,
is p-convex, to the problem of deciding whether its connected components Gi are pi -convex, for 1 ≤ p ≤ n. This theorem
leads to Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 Algorithm for convex p-partition of a disconnected graph.
(i) For
∑each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ ω, determine the largest pi ≤ p such that Gi is pi -convex;
(ii) If 1≤i≤ω pi ≥ p, then G is p-convex; otherwise G is not p-convex.

We remark that using Algorithm 1, we can determine in polynomial-time if a disconnected graph is p-convex, for graph
classes for which there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to determine if a connected graph is p-convex. The complexity
of a brute force algorithm based on Algorithm 1 is O(pωX ), where O(X ) is the complexity to test if the connected graph, Gi ,
is pi -convex.
7. Cographs
Finally we examine convex partitions of cographs. A graph is a cograph if it does not contain P4 as an induced subgraph.
We note that G is a non-trivial connected cograph if and only if G is a disconnected cograph.
Theorem 19. Let p ≥ 2, the following sentences are equivalent for a connected cograph G:
(i) G is p-convex;
(ii) G is strong p-convex;
(iii) Either G is p-colorable or G contains exactly one non-trivial connected component H, such that H = G[V (H )] has a
quasi-clique convex p-partition.
Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii) Let G be a convex graph and consider any convex p-partition V = (V1 , . . . , Vp ) of G. Suppose that V contains
two sets that are not cliques, for instance V1 and V2 . This implies that two non-adjacent vertices v, v ′ ∈ V1 belong to the
same connected component of G. Similarly for two non-adjacent vertices u, u′ ∈ V2 . Suppose that these four vertices are
in distinct connected components of G then v ∈ I [u, u′ ] ⊆ V2 , which is a contradiction. Hence, these four vertices belong
to the same connected component of G. But this implies that a vertex which is not in this connected component belongs to
both V1 and V2 , another contradiction.
(ii) ⇒ (iii) Let G be a strong p-convex graph. If G has only trivial connected components, then V (G) is a clique and G is
p-colorable.
Suppose that G has exactly one non-trivial connected component H. Clearly, if V (H ) ≤ p, then G is p-colorable. From
now on we consider |V (H )| > p. Let V = (V1 , . . . , Vp ) be a quasi-clique convex p-partition of G. If V only contains cliques,
then G is p-colorable. If V contains exactly one non-clique, then let v, v ′ be two non-adjacent vertices of V1 . All trivial
connected components of G belong to I [v, v ′ ] ⊆ V1 . Hence the sets V2 , . . . , Vp are formed by vertices of H. Consequently,
V ′ = (V1 ∩ H , V2 , . . . , Vp ) is a quasi-clique convex p-partition of H.

Fig. 3. Scheme of the cotree of cograph G. White vertices are non-trivial connected components and the black vertices are trivial connected components.

Now consider that G has at least two non-trivial connected components and suppose by contradiction that G is not pcolorable. Let V = (V1 , . . . , Vp ) be a quasi-clique convex p-partition of G. Then there exists a set of V , for instance V1 , with
non-adjacent vertices u, u′ , otherwise G would be p-colorable. Hence, u and u′ belong to the same connected component of
G, say H1 . This implies that any vertex of any other connected component of G must belong to V1 . But, since G has at least
two non-trivial connected components, there exists a connected component H2 with two non-adjacent vertices v, v ′ ∈ V1 .
Since H1 ⊆ I [v, v ′ ], we conclude that V1 = V (G), a contradiction.
(iii) ⇒ (i) If G is p-colorable then G is p-convex. If G is not p-colorable and has exactly one non-trivial connected
component H, such that H contains a quasi-clique convex p-partition V = (V1 , . . . , Vp ). Then we can obtain a convex
p-partition for G by adding the vertices V (G) \ V (H ) to the set of V that is not a clique.
The previous theorem gives conditions to develop an algorithm to decide if a connected cograph G is p-convex. This
algorithm uses the cotree of the graph G [11]. The cotree TG of G is a tree rooted at G such that the children of each node of
TG are the connected components of its complement. The leaves of TG are the vertices of G.
In Fig. 3, we schematically exhibit the first levels of the cotree of G. The black vertices represent trivial connected
components and the white ones are non-trivial. By Theorem 19, to decide if G is p-convex we need to check the number
of non-trivial connected components of G. Since G has just one non-trivial connected component G′ , we need to verify if
G[V (G′ )] is p-convex. Since G[V (G′ )] is disconnected we cannot use an algorithm based on Theorem 19. By Theorem 18, it is
important to determine the largest p′i , less than or equal to p, such that G′i is p′i -convex for all connected components of the
graph G[V (G′ )]. Therefore, we use Theorem 19 to determine p′i , for all G′i . First we note that G′3 is trivial, since |V (G′3 )| ≤ p,
then p′3 = |V (G′3 )| = 1; suppose that |V (G′1 )| > p and |V (G′2 )| > p, to G′1 and G′2 we need to apply Theorem 19. Since G′1 has
two non-trivial connected components, then we need to examine if G′1 is p-colorable. Since G′2 does not have a non-trivial
connected component, then G′2 is p-convex. Although the cotree TG has more vertices, we do not need to analyze all the
vertices of TG to answer whether G is p-convex.
We describe Algorithm 2 based on Theorems 18 and 19. Let G be a connected cograph. The algorithm decides the largest
pG ≤ p, such that G is pG -convex by analyzing the children of G in the cotree TG . If it is not possible to determine pG , we
recursively repeat the process to the children of G in TG (possibly, not all of them). We modify Algorithm 1 for disconnected
cographs. We also use the linear-time algorithm to determine the cotree [11] of a cograph.
Before presenting the algorithm, we need some definitions. Let H be a connected cograph, ω(H ) is the number of
connected components of H, while ω′ (H ) denotes the number of non-trivial connected components of H. If H has just one
non-trivial connected component we denote this component by H ′ ; the connected components of a cograph H are called
H1 , . . . , Hω(H ) ; f (H , p) ≤ p is the largest integer such that H is f (H , p)-convex.
The Algorithm 2 determines f (H , p) for a cograph H in TG . Hence, to determine if a connected cograph G is p-convex we
determine the cotree TG and check if f (G, p) = p.
Theorem 20. If G is a cograph, then we can decide in time O(n + m) if G is p-convex.
Proof. The complexity of determining the cotree is O(n + m) and the cotree has O(n) nodes [11]. At each visited node H the
algorithm can: (i) determine in O(1) time the value of f (H , p); (ii) visit the children of H; (iii) decide if χ (H ) ≤ p. In steps
(i) and (iii), Algorithm 2 does not make recursive calls to the children of H. In (iii), if we determine χ (H1 ) and χ (H2 ), for
two different nodes H1 and H2 of TG , then V (H1 ) and V (H2 ) are disjoints. We know, by [10,11], that χ (H ) can be calculated
in O(V (H ) + E (H )) time, for any node H of TG . Hence the complexity of the Algorithm 2 is O(n + m). By Theorem 18, for

8. Conclusion
We have considered the problem of the partition of V (G) into p convex sets. We have proved that the problem is NPcomplete for fixed values of p ≥ 2.
We also have shown that chordal graphs are p-convex, for 1 ≤ p ≤ n, and described a linear-time algorithm to decide
whether a cograph is p-convex. We have shown that powers of cycles Cnk are p-convex, for p ≥ 3. We also have determined
conditions on n and k, which determine whether a power of cycle is biconvex.
Finally, we mention that we have also considered the problem of deciding whether a graph has a cover into p convex
sets. We define the convex cover of a graph G as a family of convex subsets of V (G), such that the union of these sets is equal
to V (G) and none of these sets is contained in the union of other sets of the family. The concepts of convex partitions and
convex covers are distinct. Fig. 4 shows an example of a graph that has a cover into 2 convex sets but no partition into 2
convex sets. The results presented in this article are directly extensible for the convex cover problem. However, we do not
know if there exists a linear-time algorithm to decide if a cograph has a cover into p convex sets.

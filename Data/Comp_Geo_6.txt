Abstract Voronoi diagrams (AVDs) are based on bisecting curves enjoying simple
combinatorial properties, rather than on the geometric notions of sites and circles. They
serve as a unifying concept. Once the bisector system of any concrete type of Voronoi
diagram is shown to fulﬁll the AVD properties, structural results and eﬃcient algorithms
become available without further effort.
In a concrete order-k Voronoi diagram, all points are placed into the same region that have
the same k nearest neighbors among the given sites. This paper is the ﬁrst to study abstract
Voronoi diagrams of arbitrary order k. We prove that their complexity in the plane is upper
bounded by 2k(n − k). So far, an O (k(n − k)) bound has been shown only for point sites
in the Euclidean and L p planes, and, recently, for line segments, in the L p metric. These
proofs made extensive use of the geometry of the sites.
Our result on AVDs implies a 2k(n − k) upper bound for a wide range of cases for
which only trivial upper complexity bounds were previously known, and a slightly sharper
bound for the known cases. Also, our proof shows that the reasons for this bound are
combinatorial properties of certain permutation sequences.

1. Introduction
Voronoi diagrams are useful structures, known in many areas of science. The underlying idea goes back to Descartes [13].
There are sites p , q that exert inﬂuence on their surrounding space, M. Each point of M is assigned to that site p (resp. to
those sites p 1 , . . . , pk ) for which the inﬂuence is strongest. Points assigned to the same site(s) form Voronoi regions.
The nature of the sites, the measure of inﬂuence, and space M can vary. The order, k, can range from 1 to n − 1 if n
sites are given. For k = 1 the standard nearest Voronoi diagram results, while for k = n − 1 the farthest Voronoi diagram
is obtained, where all points of M having the same farthest site belong in the same Voronoi region. In this paper we are
interested in values of k between 1 and n − 1; here an order-k Voronoi region contains all points that have the same k
nearest sites. Observe that the order of the Voronoi diagram has nothing to do with the dimension of the space of its

embedding. In this paper we consider diagrams in the 2-dimensional plane. For more Voronoi diagrams see the surveys and
monographs [5–7,11,14,24].
A lot of attention has been given to nearest Voronoi diagrams in the plane. Many concrete cases have the following
features in common. The locus of all points at identical distance to two sites p , q is an unbounded curve J ( p , q). It bisects
the plane into two domains, D ( p , q) and D (q, p ); domain D ( p , q) consists of all points closer to p than to q. Intersecting
all D ( p , q), where q = p for a ﬁxed p, results in the Voronoi region VR( p , S ) of p with respect to site set S. It equals the
set of all points with unique nearest neighbor p in S. If geodesics exist, Voronoi regions are pathwise connected, and the
union of their closures covers the plane, since each point has at least one nearest neighbor in S.
In abstract Voronoi diagrams [17,18] (AVDs, for short) no sites or distance measures are given. Instead, one takes as
primary objects unbounded curves J ( p , q) = J (q, p ), homeomorphic to unbounded lines, together with the domains D ( p , q)
and D (q, p ) they separate. Nearest abstract Voronoi regions are deﬁned by

VR( p , S ) :=

D ( p , q),
q∈ S \{ p }

and now one requires that the following properties hold true for each nonempty subset S of S.
(A1) Each nearest Voronoi region VR( p , S ) is pathwise connected.
(A2) Each point of the plane belongs to the closure of a nearest Voronoi region VR( p , S ).
Two more, rather technical, assumptions on the curves J ( p , q) are stated in Deﬁnition 1 below. It has been shown that the
resulting nearest AVDs—the plane minus all Voronoi regions—are planar graphs of complexity O (n). They can be constructed,
by randomized incremental construction, in O (n log n) many steps [18,19,22]. Moreover, properties (A1) and (A2) need only
be checked for all subsets S of size three [18]. This makes it easier to verify that a concrete Voronoi diagram is under the
umbrella of the AVD concept. Examples of such applications can be found in [1–3,8,16,22]. Farthest abstract Voronoi diagrams
consist of regions VR∗ ( p , S ) := q∈ S \{ p } D (q, p ). They have been shown to be trees of complexity O (n), computable in
expected O (n log n) many steps [23].
In this paper we consider, for the ﬁrst time, general order-k abstract Voronoi regions, deﬁned by

VRk ( P , S ) :=

D ( p , q),
p ∈ P , q∈ S \ P

for each subset P of S of size k. The order-k abstract Voronoi diagram V k ( S ) is deﬁned to be the complement of all order-k
Voronoi regions in the plane; it equals the collection of all edges that separate order-k Voronoi regions (Lemma 4). In
addition to properties (A1) and (A2) we shall assume the following for each nonempty subset S of S.
(A3) No nearest Voronoi region VR( p , S ) is empty.
Observe that our axioms are required to hold only for the nearest-, i.e. for the order-1 Voronoi diagram. In Lemma 1 we
prove that property (A3) need only be tested for all subsets S of size four. Clearly, (A3) holds in all concrete cases where
each nearest region contains its site.
Fig. 1 shows two concrete order-2 diagrams of points and line segments under the Euclidean metric. We observe that
the order-2 Voronoi region of line segments s1 , s2 is disconnected, whereas for points the higher-order regions are still
connected. In general, a Voronoi region in V 2 ( S ) can have n − 1 connected components [25]. Fig. 2 depicts a curve system
fulﬁlling all the required properties, and the resulting abstract Voronoi diagrams of orders 1 to 4. An index p placed next
to a curve indicates the side of the curve where D ( p , q) lies. The dashed curves represent arcs of the bisectors that do not
appear as Voronoi edges in the diagram. The order-2 region of p 1 and p 2 consists of four connected components.

In this paper we are proving the following result on the number of 2-dimen-sional faces of order-k abstract Voronoi
diagrams.
Theorem 1. (Short version.) The abstract order-k Voronoi diagram V k ( S ) has at most 2k(n − k) many faces.
So far, an O (k(n − k)) bound had been shown only for points [20,21], and recently for line-segments [25], in the L p
metric.1 The structural properties of the diagram for line segments turned out surprisingly different from those for points,
including disconnected Voronoi regions and a lack of symmetry between the number of unbounded regions in the order-k
and order-(n − k) diagrams. The differences clearly propagate in the abstract setting. The proofs of these results are based
on geometric arguments, including results on k-sets,2 point-line duality and ≤ k-levels in arrangements. None of these
arguments applies to abstract Voronoi diagrams.
However, the upper bound on k-sets established in [4] had a combinatorial proof; it was obtained by analyzing the
cyclic permutation sequences that result when projecting n point sites onto a rotating line. In such a sequence, consecutive
n
permutations differ by a switch of adjacent elements, and permutations at distance 2 are inverse to each other.
In this paper we prove Theorem 1 using combinatorial arguments. We traverse the unbounded edges of higher order
AVDs, and obtain a strictly larger class of cyclic permutation sequences, where consecutive permutations differ by switches
and any two elements switch exactly twice. Our proof is based on a tight upper bound to the number of switches that can
occur among the ﬁrst k + 1 elements; see Lemma 9. It is interesting to observe that in our class, each permutation sequence
can be realized by an AVD (Lemma 10), while this is not the case for the sequences obtained by point projection [15].
It is tempting to think that one could easily use the techniques from Clarkson and Shor [12] to prove these bounds. But
for abstract Voronoi diagrams there appear some special phenomena which complicate this task, as will be discussed in the
conclusion, Section 6.
To avoid technical complications we are assuming, in the ﬁrst 4 sections of this paper, that any two input curves J ( p , q)
intersect in a ﬁnite number of points, these intersections are transversal, and that Voronoi vertices are of degree 3. How to
get rid of the ﬁrst assumption has been shown for the case of nearest AVDs in [18]. In Section 5 we show that also vertices
of higher degree than 3 can be allowed.
Theorem 1 implies a 2k(n − k) upper complexity bound on a wide range of order-k Voronoi diagrams for which no good
bounds were previously known. For example, sites may be disjoint convex objects of constant complexity in L 2 or under the

In the L 1 and L ∞ metrics, the bound is slightly tighter, i.e., O ((n − k)2 ) for k > n/2 [25].
We call a subset of size k of n points a k-set if it can be separated by a line passing through two other points. Such k-sets correspond to unbounded
order-(k + 1) Voronoi edges.

Hausdorff metric. For point sites, distance can be measured by any metric d satisfying the following conditions: points in
general position have unbounded bisector curves; d-circles are of constant algebraic complexity; each d-circle contains an
L 2 -circle and vice versa; for any two points a = c there is a third point b = a, c such that d(a, c ) = d(a, b) + d(b, c ) holds. This
includes all convex distance functions of constant complexity, but also the Karlsruhe metric where motions are constrained
to radial or circular segments with respect to a ﬁxed center point. A third example are point sites with additive weights
a p , aq that satisfy |a p − aq | < | p − q|, for any two sites p = q; see [6] for a discussion of these examples.
Using Theorem 1, the ﬁrst algorithm computing the abstract order-k Voronoi diagram has been presented in [10]. It runs
in expected time O (kn1+ ).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present some basic facts about AVDs. Then, in Section 3,
permutation sequences will be studied, in order to establish an upper bound to the number of unbounded Voronoi edges of
order at most k. This will lead, in Section 4, to a tight upper bound for the number of faces of order k. Finally, in Section 5
we show how to get rid of the general position assumption and maintain the same result for the number of order-k faces.
A preliminary version of this work with incomplete proofs and without generalizations appeared in [9].
2. Preliminaries
In this section we present some basic facts on abstract Voronoi diagrams of various orders.
Deﬁnition 1. A curve system J := { J ( p , q) : p = q ∈ S } is called admissible if it fulﬁlls, axioms (A1), (A2), (A3) stated in the
introduction, and in addition the following ones.
(A4) Each curve J ( p , q), where p = q, is unbounded. After stereographic projection to the sphere, it can be completed to a
closed Jordan curve through the north pole.
(A5) Any two curves J ( p , q) and J (r , t ) have only ﬁnitely many intersection points, and these intersections are transversal.
Axiom (A4) implies that each bisecting curve J ( p , q) is homeomorphic to an unbounded line in the plane. As part of
the Jordan curve theorem, J ( p , q) separates the plane into two domains, the two dominance regions D ( p , q) and D (q, p ).
Further, for each point z on J ( p , q) there exists a suﬃciently small neighborhood U ( z), such that U ( z) \ J ( p , q) consists of
exactly two connected components, see also [18, Theorem 4] for a more detailed discussion.
Each transversal intersection v between two related bisectors J ( p , q) and J ( p , r ) is a Voronoi vertex in the order-1
diagram of { p , q, r }, and J (q, r ) runs also through v, compare [17]. Together with the Euler formula and our axioms we
obtain that any two related bisectors J ( p , q) and J ( p , r ) may intersect in at most two points.
Fortunately, veriﬁcation of our axioms can be based on constant size examples. Pairs and quadruples of sites are clearly
suﬃcient to verify axioms (A4) and (A5). Axioms (A1) and (A2) can be veriﬁed by checking all subsets of S of size 3, see [18,
Section 4.3]. For axiom (A3) we need to check subsets of size 4 as shown in the following lemma; checking subsets of size 3
is not always enough, as shown in Fig. 3.
Lemma 1. To verify axiom (A3), assuming that axioms (A1) and (A2) hold, it is suﬃcient to check all subsets S of S of size 4.
Proof. If all bisecting curves are straight lines, (A3) follows from Helly’s theorem on convex sets, stating that for a ﬁnite
collection of convex sets in the plane, if each intersection of 3 of these sets is nonempty, then the intersection of the whole
collection is nonempty.
Our bisecting curves J ( p , q) do not necessarily deﬁne convex domains D ( p , q) from which the Voronoi region VR( p , S ) =
q∈ S \{ p } D ( p , q ) is constructed. This is why a new proof is needed.
So, assume that VR( p , S ) is nonempty for all subsets S of size 4. Let | S | > 4 and for the sake of a contradiction
assume that VR( p , S ) = ∅. Let q1 , q2 , q3 ∈ S \ { p } be pairwise different. By induction on the size of S, there exist points
xi ∈ VR( p , S \ {qi }), i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Since no point lies in VR( p , S ), we have xi ∈ D (qi , p ). By (A1), there are paths P i j connecting

xi and x j in VR( p , S \ {q i , q j }) ⊆ D ( p , qk ), where {i , j , k} = {1, 2, 3}. Because VR( p , S ) may not be empty, P i j has to be
contained in D (q i , p ) ∪ D (q j , p ), thus when traversing P i j from xi to x j one must cross J ( p , q j ) ﬁrst, before one crosses
J ( p , qi ). W.l.o.g. we can assume that P i j intersects J ( p , q i ) and J ( p , q j ) exactly once each.
Let x1 be the ﬁrst point of P 13 one meets, when traversing P 12 from its intersection with J ( p , q2 ) in the direction of
x1 , let x2 be the ﬁrst point on P 23 one meets, when traversing P 12 from its intersection with J ( p , q1 ) in the direction of
x2 , and let x3 be the ﬁrst point on P 23 one meets, when traversing P 13 from its intersection with J ( p , q1 ) in the direction
of x3 . Because P 23 cannot intersect P 12 in D (q1 , p ), P 13 cannot intersect P 12 in D (q2 , p ), and P 12 cannot intersect P 23 in
D (q3 , p ), the points x1 , x2 and x2 together with the segments of P 12 , P 23 , and P 13 in between form a simple closed curve
which bounds a domain D.
We have xi in D (qi , p ) and in D ( p , q) for all q ∈ S \ {q i } and J ( p , qi ) may not intersect P jk for {i , j , k} = {1, 2, 3}.
Further, because P 12 ⊆ D (q1 , p ) ∪ D (q2 , p ) the two bisectors J ( p , q1 ) and J ( p , q2 ) must intersect transversally in a point w
contained in the domain D; see Fig. 4. The two bisectors J ( p , q1 ) and J ( p , q2 ) divide the domain D into four subdomains
around w, A ⊆ D (q1 , p ) ∩ D (q2 , p ), B ⊆ D ( p , q1 ) ∩ D (q2 , p ), C ⊆ D ( p , q2 ) ∩ D ( p , q1 ), and E ⊆ D ( p , q2 ) ∩ D (q1 , p ).
The bisector J ( p , q3 ) enters D through P 13 and E such that the segment of P 13 in the direction of x1 is in D ( p , q3 ) and
the segment in the direction of x3 is in D (q3 , p ). J ( p , q3 ) leaves D through B and P 23 such that the segment of P 23 in the
direction of x2 is in D ( p , q3 ) and the segment in the direction of x3 is in D (q3 , p ). Because J ( p , q3 ) may intersect J ( p , q1 )
and J ( p , q2 ) in at most two points, if it traverses A then it cannot traverse C and vice versa, and it can traverse A and C in
at most one segment.
Now there are three cases, see Fig. 5.
Case 1: J ( p , q3 ) traverses A. Then it forms a bounded domain of the farthest region VR∗ ( p , { p , q1 , q2 , q3 }) in A incident to
w. This contradicts Lemma 7 (given later) whose proof is independent from this lemma.
Case 2: J ( p , q3 ) traverses C . Then it bounds VR( p , { p , q1 , q2 , q3 }) in C incident to w. Let x ∈ VR( p , { p , q1 , q2 , q3 }). Because
VR( p , S ) = ∅ there must be q ∈ S \ { p , q1 , q2 , q3 } such that x ∈ D (q, p ). But the boundary of the domain D is
contained in D ( p , q), implying that J ( p , q) is closed—a contradiction to (A4).
Case 3: J ( p , q3 ) traverses neither A nor C and must hence run through w. Since VR( p , { p , q1 , q2 , q3 }) must not be empty,
by (A3), J ( p , q3 ) has to traverse through D ( p , q1 ) ∩ D ( p , q2 ), but then it must intersect J ( p , q1 ) or J ( p , q2 ) in
another point, resulting in a disconnection of VR( p , { p , q1 , q3 }) or VR( p , { p, q2 , q3 }) that contradicts (A1). ✷
The following fact will be very useful in the sequel. Its proof can be found in [18, Lemma 5].
Lemma 2. For all p , q, r in S, D ( p , q) ∩ D (q, r ) ⊆ D ( p , r ) holds.

Consequently, a total ordering of the set S is possible for x ∈
/

p ,q∈ S

J ( p , q), where

p <x q :⇐⇒ x ∈ D ( p , q).
Informally, one can interpret p <x q as “x is closer to p than to q”. We will write p < q if it is clear which x ∈ R2 we are
referring to.
As a direct consequence we show that property (A2) holds also for abstract order-k Voronoi regions.
Lemma 3. Let J = { J ( p , q) : p = q ∈ S } be an admissible curve system. Then for each k ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}

R2 =

VRk ( P , S ).
P ⊆ S ,| P |=k

Proof. Let x ∈ R2 . If x is not contained in any bisecting curve J ( p , q) then it belongs to the order-k region VRk ( P , S ), where
P = { p 1 , . . . , pk } are the k smallest elements of S with respect to the ordering <x . Otherwise, x lies on the boundary of a
domain D ⊂ R2 \ p =q∈ S J ( p , q), and D fully belongs to an order-k region. ✷
The proofs of the following Lemmata 4 and 5 are similar to the proof of Lemma 3. Lemma 5 indicates that two neighboring regions differ in exactly one site.
Lemma 4.

V k(S) =

VRk ( P , S ) ∩ VRk ( P , S )
P =P ⊂S
| P |=| P |=k

Lemma 5. If the intersection E := VRk ( P , S ) ∩ VRk ( P , S ) is not empty, there are sites p ∈ P and p ∈ P such that P \ { p } = P \ { p },
and E ⊆ J ( p , p ) holds. For each point x ∈ VRk ( P , S ) near E, index p is the k-th with respect to <x , while for points x in VRk ( P , S )
index p appears at position k.
In particular, D ( p , p ) is on the same side of J ( p , p ) as VRk ( P , S ).
If F , F are connected components (faces) of VRk ( P , S ) and VRk ( P , S ), respectively, the intersection F ∩ F can be empty,
or otherwise be of dimension 0 (Voronoi vertices) or 1 (Voronoi edges).
For the next lemma we assume that all vertices are of degree 3. Recall that if two related bisectors J ( p , q) and J ( p , r )
intersect in a point v, then J (q, r ) runs also through v, [17], and v is a Voronoi vertex of the order-1 Voronoi diagram of
{ p , q, r }. Thus, when assuming that all Voronoi vertices are of degree 3, no other bisector related to one of the sites p , q, r
can run through v.
Let P 1 , P 2 , P 3 ⊂ S be the sets deﬁning the adjacent to v order-k Voronoi regions in clockwise order, see Fig. 6. As with
the concrete order-k Voronoi diagrams, vertex v can be of two types, depending on the nature of sets P 1 , P 2 , P 3 [20]. There
are two cases. In the ﬁrst case, there exists a set H ⊂ S of size k − 1 and three more sites p , q, r ∈ S satisfying

P 1 = H ∪ { p }, P 2 = H ∪ {q}, P 3 = H ∪ {r }.
Then vertex v is called new in V k ( S ), or of nearest type. In the second case, there is a subset K ⊂ S of size k − 2 and three
more sites p , q, r ∈ S such that

P 1 = K ∪ { p , r }, P 2 = K ∪ {q, r }, P 3 = K ∪ { p , q}.
Then vertex v is called old in V k ( S ), or of farthest type.
To see that these are indeed the only two cases, we walk around v in clockwise order along the boundary of an
-neighborhood, see Fig. 6. Let the edge between P 1 and P 2 belong to the bisector J ( p , q), such that P 1 ⊆ D ( p , q) and
P 2 ⊆ D (q, p ). If q is still last in the ordering of the sites when we reach the edge between P 2 and P 3 , then this edge must

545

Fig. 7. Farthest AVDs cannot contain bounded regions.

belong to the bisector J (q, r ) for an r ∈ S \ { p , q}. Thus, bisector J (r , p ) must run through v, and because no other bisector
related to r may contain v, a segment of J (r , p ) deﬁnes the edge between P 2 and P 3 . Thus, we have the ﬁrst case.
If q is no longer last in this ordering, then we must have crossed a bisector J (q, r ) related to q while traversing P 2 . Again,
J ( p , r ) must contain v, and thus, no other bisector related to r may run through v. Thus, r is in last position when we reach
the edge between P 2 and P 3 and the edge must belong to J (r , p ). Next, because all bisector intersections are transversal
(A5), we cross the bisector J ( p , q), and p changes its position in the ordering with q, which is now in last position. The
next bisector is J (q, r ), and because q is in last position, this deﬁnes the edge between P 2 and P 3 . This implies the second
case and no other conﬁguration is possible.
The proof of the following lemma follows quite directly from these deﬁnitions.
Lemma 6. Let v be a new vertex in V k ( S ). Then v is an old vertex of V k+1 ( S ), and v lies in the interior of a face of V k+2 ( S ), i.e., v is
not a vertex of V k+2 ( S ). Furthermore, every edge of V k ( S ) is enclosed by a face of V k+1 ( S ).
Already in [23] it has been shown that farthest abstract Voronoi diagrams are trees, under a slightly different deﬁnition
of admissible curves. In this paper we give a short alternative proof of this fact based on our axioms (A1)–(A5).
Lemma 7. The farthest abstract Voronoi diagram V ∗ ( S ) is a tree.
Proof. Let | S | = n. Suppose some farthest region VR∗ ( p , S ) has a face F that is bounded. Let its boundary consist of edges
e 1 , . . . , e i in this order, such that each edge e j is a segment of a bisector J ( p , q j ). The sites q j need not be pairwise
different, but consecutive edges belong to different bisecting curves. Let x j be the intersection point between e j and e j +1
on the boundary of F , and xi the intersection point between e i and e 1 on F , see Fig. 7.
If n = 1, then there exists no bounded Voronoi region. If n = 2, there can be at most one edge e 1 on the boundary of
V ∗ ( p , S ), implying that e 1 and J ( p , q1 ) would be closed a contradiction to (A4).
Now let n > 2, and let i ≥ 2. By induction on n, VR∗ ( p , S \ {qi }) is unbounded (it still contains F and is thus not empty).
Let z be a point in F , then there exists an unbounded arc L ⊆ V ∗ ( p , S \ {qi }) emanating from z to inﬁnity. L may not
intersect any J ( p , q1 ), . . . , J ( p , qi ) except for J ( p , q i ), thus it must leave F through J ( p , q i ), w.l.o.g. let its last intersection
with the boundary of F be on e i .
Because of (A5), there is a point x in the -neighborhood of xi −1 contained in D ( p , q i −1 ) ∩ D ( p , qi ) and a point y in the
-neighborhood of xi contained in D ( p , q1 ) ∩ D ( p , qi ). We claim that any path πx, y from x to y must intersect J ( p , q i ) or L.
This is immediate, because by construction x and y are on the same side of the unbounded curve J ( p , q i ) and on opposite
sides of L.
Because of (A3), there exists a point w ∈ VR( p , { p , q1 , qi −1 , qi }) (q1 may be equal to q i ). The point w is also contained
in both VR( p , { p , q1 , qi }) and VR( p , { p , q i −1 , qi }). The point y is contained in VR( p , { p , q1 , qi }) and because of (A1) there
exists a path π y w from y to w in VR( p , { p , q1 , qi }) and thus intersecting neither L nor J ( p , q i ). The point x is contained
in VR( p , { p , q i −1 , qi }) and thus there exists a path πxw from x to w in VR( p , { p , q i −1 , qi }) also intersecting neither L nor
J ( p , qi ). But then the concatenation of πxw and π y w is a path connecting x and y without intersecting L and J ( p , q i ), a
contradiction.
It remains to show that V ∗ ( S ) is connected. Suppose there is a curve C separating parts of V ∗ ( S ). Then C ⊂ VR∗ ( p , S )
for a p ∈ S, C ∩ D ( p , q) = ∅ for all q ∈ S \ { p } and there are q = r ∈ S such that D ( p , q) lies on one side of C and D ( p , r ) on
the other side. But then VR( p , { p , q, r }) would be empty. ✷

3. Bounding the number of unbounded edges of V ≤k ( S )
Let Γ be a closed Jordan curve in R2 large enough such that no pair of bisectors cross on or outside of Γ (axiom (A5)),
each bisector crosses Γ exactly twice and these intersections are transversal (axiom (A4)). One could choose Γ as the
boundary of a suﬃciently small neighborhood of the north pole of the sphere, projected stereographically to the plane,
such that for any bisector J ( p , q), the set Γ \ J ( p , q) consist of exactly two connected components. This is possible by
Lemma 2.3.1 in [17].
If we traverse Γ around the Voronoi diagram, the ordering <x on S changes whenever we cross a bisector J ( p , q). Here
indices p and q change their relation according to <x .
Lemma 8. When we cross a bisector J ( p , q), then p and q change their places in the ordering <x along Γ . Further, they are adjacent
to each other just before and after the crossing.
Proof. Let p i < p j , and assume that we cross J ( p i , p j ), which means that p i < p j changes to p j < p i . Let pk < p i , p j
before we cross J ( p i , p j ). Because of the construction of Γ no other bisector has been crossed at the same time, thus
pk < p i , p j remains. The same happens for a pk > p i , p j . Now let p i < pk < p j before we cross J ( p i , p j ). Then we still have
p i < pk < p j afterwards, but now p j < p i , a contradiction to the transitivity. Thus p i and p j must have been adjacent right
before and after we cross J ( p i , p j ) and hence they change their places in the ordering. ✷
We call such a change in the ordering of S a switch between the two sites p and q, which must be adjacent. There can
be only one switch at a time and each pair of sites switches exactly two times while walking one round around Γ , resulting
in n(n − 1) switches altogether.
Every time a switch among the ﬁrst k + 1 elements of the ordering occurs, there is an unbounded edge of a Voronoi
diagram of order ≤ k. This means that the maximum number of unbounded edges of all diagrams of order ≤ k is equal to the
maximum number of switches among the ﬁrst k + 1 elements in the ordering.
Permutation sequences and estimates for the maximum number of switches among the ﬁrst k elements have been used
in [4] to bound the number of k-sets of n points in the plane. These sequences resulted from projecting n points in general
n
position onto a rotating line. Hence, they were of length 2N, where N = 2 , and they had the following properties. Adjacent
permutations differ by a transposition of adjacent elements, and any two permutations a distance N apart are inverse to
each other. It has been shown in [15] that not every permutation of this type can be realized by a point set.
In the following lemma we introduce a larger class of permutation sequences that ﬁts the AVD framework. Recall that a
switch can occur only between to adjacent elements in the ordering.
Lemma 9. Let P ( S ) be a cyclic sequence of permutations P 0 , . . . , P N = P 0 such that
(i) P i +1 differs from P i by a switch;
(ii) each pair of sites p , q ∈ S switches exactly two times in P ( S ).
Then the number of switches occurring in P ( S ) among the ﬁrst k + 1 sites is upper bounded by k(2n − k − 1). Furthermore, this bound
is tight.
Proof. Call a switch good if it involves at least one of the k ﬁrst sites of a permutation; otherwise call it bad. Let S =
{ p 1 , . . . , pn } and the initial ordering of the sites in the ﬁrst permutation be p 1 < . . . < pn . For i ∈ {k + 2, . . . , n}, deﬁne B i as
the set of bad switches where p i is switching with a site in { p 1 , . . . , p i −1 }. We remark that the sets B i , for i ∈ {k + 2, . . . , n},
are pairwise disjoint. If p i is not involved in a good switch, then all its 2i − 2 switches with sites in { p 1 , . . . , p i −1 } are bad.
Otherwise, for p i to be involved in a good switch, it must ﬁrst be involved in at least i − k − 1 bad switches with sites in
{ p 1 , . . . , p i −1 }, in order to reach the ﬁrst k + 1 positions, and since P 0 = P N , p i has to be involved in as many bad switches
in order to return to its original place in the ordering. In both cases, | B i | ≥ 2(i − k − 1). Because of (ii), the total number of
n
switches is N = 2 2 . Therefore the number of good switches is at most

j = k(2n − k − 1),

where j = i − k − 1.
To show that the bound is tight, let again the initial ordering of the ﬁrst permutation be p 1 < . . . < pn . We switch each
p i with p i −1 , . . . , p 1 in decreasing index order such that p i now is the ﬁrst element and then in inverse order back to
its original position. Start with i = 2 and continue until i = n. Then the number of switches among the ﬁrst k + 1 sites is
n−k−1
n
exactly 2 2 − 2 j =1 j. ✷
In contradistinction to the result in [15], each such permutation sequence can be realized by an AVD. The following
Lemma 10 will be used for proving that the upper bound shown in Lemma 11 is tight.

Lemma 10. Let P ( S ) be a sequence of permutations as in Lemma 9. There exists an abstract Voronoi diagram where the ordering of
the sites along Γ changes according to P ( S ).
Proof. We show that for | S | = 3 each P ( S ) fulﬁlling the above properties can be realized by an AVD. If | S | ≥ 3, we can
consider V ( S ) such that each triple p , q, r of sites changes its ordering on Γ according to P ( S ). This is possible because if
the curve system of each triple of sites is admissible then the curve system of S is admissible, too; see [18]. Now if there
are two bisectors J ( p , q) and J (r , t ) having a different order on Γ than p , q, r , t have in P ( S ), then p , q, r , t are pairwise
different, and neither of the bisectors J ( p , r ), J ( p , t ), J (q, r ) or J (q, t ) can occur between the two bisectors J ( p , q) and
J (r , t ) on Γ . Otherwise, suppose w.l.o.g. that J ( p , r ) occurs between J ( p , q) and J (r , t ); then { p , q, r } would not have the
same ordering on Γ as in P ( S ), a contradiction to our assumption. Thus the bisectors J ( p , q) and J (r , t ) can be deformed
such that their ordering on Γ changes, but the structure of V ( S ) remains the same.
Now let S = { p , q, r }. Then there are three different cases:
(1) Each site switches into the ﬁrst position exactly once.
(2) One site switches into the ﬁrst position exactly twice; it cannot do so more often because then it would have to switch
with one of the other sites more often than twice. Further, it implies that all other sites must switch themselves into
ﬁrst position exactly once.
(3) One site never moves to ﬁrst position. This implies that both the other sites switch to ﬁrst position exactly once;
otherwise, either one site would remain in ﬁrst position during the whole permutation, but then it would never switch
with any other site, or the two other sites would have to switch more than twice.
Let P 0 = ( p , q, r ). Then there are two possibilities for P 1 in case (1): Either P 1 = (q, p , r ), which leads to the sequence
P 0 = ( p , q, r )
P 1 = (q, p , r )
P 2 = (q, r , p ), otherwise r never switches into ﬁrst position or p switches into ﬁrst position twice
P 3 = (r , q, p ), otherwise r never switches into ﬁrst position
P 4 = (r , p , q), otherwise q switches into ﬁrst position a second time
P 5 = ( p , r , q), otherwise p and q switch more than twice
P 6 = ( p , q, r ), otherwise P 0 = P 6 ;
or P 1 = ( p , r , q), which leads to the same permutation sequence in inverse order.
Assume that p is the site that switches into ﬁrst position twice in case (2). Then we get the following permutation sequence:
P 0 = ( p , q, r )
P 1 = (q, p , r ), then
P 2 = ( p , q, r ), otherwise P 2 = (q, r , p ) which leads to the permutation sequence as in case (1)
P 3 = ( p , r , q), otherwise p and q switch more than twice
P 4 = (r , p , q), otherwise r never switches into ﬁrst position
P 5 = ( p , r , q), otherwise p and q switch more than twice
P 6 = ( p , q, r ), otherwise P 0 = P 6 ;
or in inverse order.
Assume that r is the site that never switches into ﬁrst position in case (3). Then we get the following permutation sequence:
P 0 = ( p , q, r )
P 1 = (q, p , r ), then
P 2 = (q, r , p ), otherwise p switches into ﬁrst position twice
P 3 = (q, p , r ), otherwise r switches into ﬁrst position
P 4 = ( p , q, r ), otherwise p and r switch more than twice
P 5 = ( p , r , q), otherwise p and q switch more than twice
P 6 = ( p , q, r ), otherwise P 0 = P 6 ;
or in inverse order.
These permutation sequences can be realized by the AVDs depicted in Fig. 8.

Let S i be the number of unbounded edges in V i ( S ). If an edge e has got two unbounded endpieces, i.e. edge e bounding
a p- and q-region is the whole bisector J ( p , q), then e is counted twice as an unbounded edge.
Lemma 11. Let k ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. Then,
k

k(k + 1) ≤

S i ≤ k(2n − k − 1).
i =1

Both bounds can be attained.
Proof. The second bound follows directly from Lemma 9. The ﬁrst bound follows from the fact that the minimum number
of switches among the ﬁrst (k + 1) sites is greater or equal to the total number of switches, n(n − 1), minus the maximum
number of switches among the last (n − k) sites, which again is equal to the maximum number of switches among the ﬁrst
(n − k) sites. Using Lemma 9 this implies
k

S i ≥ n(n − 1) − (n − k − 1)(2n − (n − k − 1) − 1) = k(k + 1).
i =1

The tightness of the bounds follows from Lemma 10.

✷

4. Bounding the number of faces of V k ( S )
In the following, we assume that each Voronoi vertex is of degree 3. The following two lemmata give combinatorial
proofs for facts that were previously shown by geometric arguments [20,25].
Lemma 12. Let H be a subset of S of size k + 1 and F a face of VRk+1 ( H , S ). The portion of V k ( S ) enclosed in F is exactly the farthest
Voronoi diagram V ∗ ( H ) intersected with F .
Proof. “⇒”: Let x ∈ F and suppose x ∈ VRk ( H , S ) for H ⊂ S of size k. Since F ⊆ VRk+1 ( H , S ) it follows that x ∈ D ( p , q) for
all p ∈ H and q ∈ S \ H , implying H ⊂ H . Let H \ H = {r }, then x ∈ D ( p , r ) for all p ∈ H and hence x ∈ VR∗ (r , H ).
“⇐”: Let x ∈ F and x ∈ VR∗ (r , H ). Then x ∈ D ( p , q) for all p ∈ H and q ∈ S \ H and x ∈ D ( p , r ) for all p ∈ H \ {r }. This
implies x ∈ VRk ( H \ {r }, S ). ✷
Lemma 13. Let F be a face of VRk ( H , S ), H ⊆ S, | H | = k ≥ 2. Then V ∗ ( H ) ∩ F is a nonempty tree.
Proof. First we show that V ∗ ( H ) ∩ F is not empty by assuming the opposite. Then there is a p ∈ H such that F ⊆ VR∗ ( p , H ).
Let F ⊆ VRk ( H , S ) be a face of V k ( S ) adjacent to F along an edge e. By Lemma 5, we have H = U ∪ {q} and H = U ∪ {q },
where q, q are different and not contained in U . Also, e ⊆ J (q, q ) holds. If p were in U , we would obtain F ⊆ D ( p , q) and
F ⊆ V ∗ ( p , H ) ⊆ D (q, p ), hence e ⊆ J ( p , q)—a contradiction to axiom (A5). Thus, p ∈
/ U , which means p = q. Now Lemma 5
implies that each edge on the boundary of F has to be a segment of a curve J ( p , q j ) such that D ( p , q j ) lies on the F -side.
Let q1 , . . . , qi be the sites for which there is such an edge e on the boundary of F . Then VR1 ( p , { p , q1 , . . . , qi }) = F , because
nearest Voronoi regions are connected thanks to axiom (A1). But from F ⊆ V ∗ ( p , H ) it follows that VR1 ( p , H ) ⊆ R2 \ F , and
hence, VR1 ( p , S ) ⊆ F ∩ R2 \ F = ∅, a contradiction to axiom (A3).
Next we show that V ∗ ( H ) ∩ F is a tree. Because of Lemma 7 it is clear that it is a forest. So it remains to prove that it is
connected. Otherwise, there would be a domain D ⊂ F , bounded by two paths P 1 , P 2 ⊂ F of V ∗ ( H ) and two disconnected
segments e 1 and e 2 of the boundary of F . There is an index p ∈ H such that D ⊆ VR∗ ( p , H ). Since V ∗ ( H ) is a tree, by
Lemma 7, the upper (or: the lower) two endpoints of P 1 and P 2 must be connected by a path P in V ∗ ( H ) that belongs to
the boundary of VR∗ ( p , H ); see Fig. 9. Here path P connects the endpoints of e 1 ; both curves together encircle a domain
D , which is part of VR∗ ( p , H ). By deﬁnition of the farthest Voronoi diagram and because e 1 is on the boundary of F
and contained in VR∗ ( p , H ), there are q1 , . . . , qi , such that e 1 ∪ P consists of segments of J ( p , q1 ), . . . , J ( p , qi ), and all
D ( p , q j ) are situated outside of D ; compare Lemma 5. But then VR∗ ( p , { p , q1 , . . . , qi }) would be bounded, a contradiction
to Lemma 7. ✷
Lemma 14. Let F be a face of VRk+1 ( H , S ) and m the number of Voronoi vertices of V k ( S ) enclosed in its interior. Then F encloses
2m + 1 Voronoi edges of V k ( S ).
Proof. See Lemmata 12 and 13.

✷

The formulae in the next two lemmata originate in [20]. Below we include their proofs from [25] for completeness.

Fig. 9. The intersection of an order-k face F and the farthest Voronoi diagram of its deﬁning sites must be a tree.

Lemma 15. Let F k , E k , V k and S k denote, respectively, the number of faces, edges, vertices, and unbounded edges in V k ( S ). Then,

E k = 3( F k − 1) − S k

(1)

V k = 2( F k − 1) − S k .

(2)

Proof. Consider V k ( S ) ∪ Γ , cut off all edges outside of Γ , and let G be the resulting graph. Then G is a connected planar
graph and for its number of faces, f , of vertices, v, and edges, e, we have f = F k + 1, v = V k + S k , e = E k + S k . Because
of the general position assumption each vertex is of degree 3 and hence 2e = 3v. Now the Euler formula v − e + f = c + 1
implies the lemma. ✷
Lemma 16. The number of faces in an AVD of order k is
k −1

F k = 2kn − k2 − n + 1 −

Si.
i =1

Proof. Let V k , V k and V k be the number of Voronoi vertices, new Voronoi vertices and old Voronoi vertices in V k ( S ),
respectively. Then because of Lemma 6 we have V k = V k + V k = V k + V k−1 .
Claim 1: F k+2 = E k+1 − 2V k .
Because of Lemma 6, every old vertex of V k+1 ( S ) lies in the interior of a face of V k+2 ( S ). Consider a face F i of V k+2 ( S ).
Let mi be the number of old vertices of V k+1 ( S ) enclosed in its interior. Then F i encloses e i = 2mi + 1 edges of V k+1 ( S );
see Lemma 14. If we sum up through all the faces in V k+2 ( S ), we obtain
F k +2

F k +2

ei = 2
i =1

Note that

m i + F k +2 .
i =1

F k+2
j =1

m j = V k+1 = V k and

F k+2
j =1

e j = E k+1 , hence F k+2 = E k+1 − 2V k .

Claim 2: The number of faces in V 1 ( S ) is F 1 = n and the number of faces in V 2 ( S ) is F 2 = 3(n − 1) − S 1 .
The ﬁrst part follows from axioms (A1) and (A3). To prove the second part, consider a face of V 2 ( S ). There are no
old vertices in V 1 ( S ), therefore the face encloses exactly one edge of V 1 ( S ) and hence F 2 = E 1 . Eq. (1) implies F 2 =
3(n − 1) − S 1 .
Now we sum up F k+2 and F k+3 to obtain

F k+3 = E k+2 + E k+1 − F k+2 − 2V k+1 − 2V k = E k+2 + E k+1 − F k+2 − 2V k+1 ;
(see Claim 1). Substituting (1) and (2) of Lemma 15 into it results in

F k+3 = 2F k+2 − F k+1 − 2 − S k+2 + S k+1 .
Using the iterative formula, the base cases F 1 = n and F 2 = 3(n − 1) − S 1 , we derive the lemma by strong induction.
Theorem 1. The number of faces F k in an AVD of order k is bounded as follows

n − k + 1 ≤ F k ≤ 2k(n − k) + k + 1 − n

≤ 2k(n − k)
∈ O (k(n − k)).
Both the upper bound 2k(n − k) + k + 1 − n and the lower bound n − k + 1 can be attained.

5. Generalizations
In [18] it has been shown, with some technical effort, that it is not necessary to require only ﬁnitely many intersection
points between each pair of bisecting curves J ( p , q) and J (r , t ). The abstract Voronoi diagram is still a ﬁnite planar graph
with ﬁnitely many vertices even if bisectors intersect in inﬁnitely many points. With the same proofs one can show that
this is also true for higher order AVDs. Observe that bisector intersections have to be considered only when resulting in a
Voronoi vertex of some order. Thus in axiom (A5) it would suﬃce to require only transversal intersections.
Another natural question is, whether the general position assumption, where each Voronoi vertex is of degree 3, is really
necessary. We can show that it is not and the number of faces of an order k AVD can only decrease if vertices have higher
degree than 3 and all bisectors intersect transversally. First we prove that all “pieces of pie” around an order k vertex are
from different order k Voronoi regions.
Lemma 17. Let v be a vertex of V k ( S ). All faces adjacent to v are from pairwise different Voronoi regions and if we walk around v, no
face appears more than once.
Proof. The proof that no face appears more than once is analogous to the proof of the simple connectivity of order-1
Voronoi regions, see [18].
Suppose there are two different faces F 1 and F 2 incident to v, both belonging to the same order k Voronoi region of
H ⊆ S. For k = 1 the regions are connected and we have a contradiction.
So let k ≥ 2. Let the left border-edge of F 1 incident to v belong to the bisector J ( p 1 , q1 ) and the right one to J ( p 2 , q2 )
such that p 1 , p 2 ∈ H and q1 , q2 ∈
/ H , in other words VRk ( H , S ) ⊆ D ( p 1 , q1 ) and ⊆ D ( p 2 , q2 ), see Fig. 10. Because F 2 is also
a face of the region of H , the bisector J ( p 1 , q1 ) has to pass on the left side between F 1 and F 2 and J ( p 2 , q2 ) has to pass
on the right side between F 1 and F 2 . But then { p 1 , q1 } = { p 2 , q2 } and the two bisectors J ( p 1 , q1 ) and J ( p 2 , q2 ) intersect
non-transversally in v contradicting axiom (A5). ✷
Now we can prove a more relaxed version of Theorem 1.
Theorem 2. Let V k ( S ) be an AVD of order k, satisfying axioms (A1) to (A5), with vertex degree ≥ 3 for all Voronoi vertices. Then the
number of faces of V k ( S ) is bounded from above by 2k(n − k).
Proof. For each vertex v of V k ( S ) with degree ≥ 4 consider a suﬃciently small ε -neighborhood U ε ( v ) around v, such that
no other intersection between bisectors lies in U ε ( v ). Use the perturbation technique of [17] to obtain degree 3 vertices in
U ε ( v ). Because of Lemma 17 the modiﬁed Voronoi diagram V k ( S ) has got at least as many faces as V k ( S ). Now Theorem 1
implies that V k ( S ) has got at most 2k(n − k) many faces. ✷
6. Concluding remarks
One may wonder if the Clarkson–Shor technique [12] can be applied to get the same complexity bound. The Clarkson–
Shor technique proves that for point sites in the Euclidean metric V k ( S ) has at most 2k(n − k − 1) new Voronoi vertices,
leading to at most 4kn − 4k2 − 2n Voronoi vertices. However, there are three problems in applying this technique to the
abstract setting. Let V k, S , V k, S , and V k, S be the numbers of Voronoi vertices, new Voronoi vertices, and old Voronoi vertices
of V k ( S ), respectively, and let F k, S and S k, S be the numbers of faces and unbounded faces of V k ( S ), respectively.
First, it is shown that V k, S + V n−k, S is 2k(n − k − 1). This proof depends on the fact that in the Euclidean metric,
V 1, R + V r −1, R is 2r − 4 for any r-element subset R of S. However, the equation V 1, R + V r −1, R = 2r − 4 does not hold in the

C. Bohler et al. / Computational Geometry 48 (2015) 539–551

abstract version since S 1, R is not necessarily S r −1, R . Actually, r − 2 ≤ V 1, R + V r −1, R ≤ 2r − 4. It is not clear how to make
use of this inequality and their technique to derive an upper bound. Second, the Clarkson–Shor technique mainly focuses
on the upper bound. No bound for the minimum number of faces in V k ( S ) is derived. Last but not least, if we assume that
V 1, R + V r −1, R = 2r − 4 holds, by the Euler formula, we have an upper bound of 2k(n − k) + S k, S /2 + 1 − n, but our derived
upper bound is 2k(n − k) + k + 1 − n. In the abstract version, it is trivial to ﬁnd a case in which S k, S /2 > k. Moreover, since
we prove the existence of an instance satisfying the bound 2k(n − k) + k + 1 − n, our bound is tight.
Another natural question is whether axioms weaker than (A1)–(A5) can still imply Theorem 1. In Section 5, we showed
that axiom (A5) can be simpliﬁed, requiring only transversal intersections, and the general position assumption can be
omitted. However, what about disconnected and empty Voronoi regions?

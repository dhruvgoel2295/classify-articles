The eﬃciency of extracting topological information from point data depends largely on
the complex that is built on top of the data points. From a computational viewpoint,
the favored complexes for this purpose have so far been Vietoris–Rips and witness
complexes. While the Vietoris–Rips complex is simple to compute and is a good vehicle for
extracting topology of sampled spaces, its size becomes prohibitively large for reasonable
computations. The witness complex on the other hand enjoys a smaller size because of
a subsampling, but fails to capture the topology in high dimensions unless imposed with
extra structure. We investigate a complex called the graph induced complex that, to some
extent, enjoys the advantages of both. It works on a subsample but still retains the power
of capturing the topology as the Vietoris–Rips complex. It only needs a graph connecting
the original sample points from which it builds a complex on the subsample thus taming
the size considerably. We show that, using the graph induced complex one can (i) infer the
one dimensional homology of a manifold from a lean subsample, (ii) reconstruct a surface
in three dimensions from a sparse subsample without computing Delaunay triangulations,
(iii) infer the persistent homology groups of compact sets from a suﬃciently dense sample.
We provide experimental evidences in support of our theory.

1. Introduction
Acquiring knowledge about a sampled space from a set of points has become a key problem in many areas of science
and engineering. The sampled space could be a hidden manifold sitting in some high dimensions, or could be a compact
subset of some Euclidean space. Topological information such as the rank of the homology groups, or their persistent behavior can divulge important features of the hidden space. Therefore, a considerable effort has ensued to extract topological
information from point data in recent years [7,9,16,19]. With the advent of advanced technologies, the data is often generated in abundance. Mixed with the burden of high dimensionality, large data sets pose a challenge to the resource required
to process them. As a result, some recent investigations have focused on how to use a lighter data structure or sparsify the
input, which aids a faster computation, but still guarantees that the output inference is correct.
Point data by themselves do not have interesting topology. So, a foremost step in inferring topology from data is to
ˇ
impose a structure such as a simplicial complex onto it. The Delaunay, Cech,
Vietoris–Rips, and witness complexes are
some of the most commonly proposed complexes for this purpose. Among these, Vietoris–Rips (Rips in short) and witness
complexes [9] have been favored because they can be constructed with simple computations. Rips complexes are easy to
construct as they can be built from a graph by recognizing the cliques in it. However, the presence of simplices correspond-

ing to all cliques makes its size quite large. Even in three dimensions with a few thousand points, the size of the Rips
complex can be an obstacle, if not a stopper, for further processing. Witness complexes, on the other hand, have too few
simplices to capture the topology of the sampled space in dimensions three or more [4]. To tackle this issue, Boissonnat et
al. [4] suggested modiﬁcations to the original deﬁnition of witness complex [12]. This enlarges the witness complexes but
makes it more complicated and costly to compute.
We investigate a new complex, a version of which was originally introduced in [18] for the application of sensor network
routing. We set up a more general deﬁnition and call it the graph induced complex. We provide new theoretical understanding of the graph induced complex in terms of topology inference. In particular, we show that, when equipped with an
appropriate metric, this complex can help deciphering the topology from data. It retains the simplicity of the Rips complex
as well as the sparsity of the witness complex. Its construction resembles the sparsiﬁed Rips complex proposed in [24] and
also the combinatorial Delaunay triangulation proposed in [6], but it does not build a Rips complex on the subsample and
thus is sparser than the Rips complex with the same set of vertices. This fact makes a real difference in practice as our preliminary experiments show. The idea of graph induced complex also bears similarity to the geodesic Delaunay triangulation
which was proposed to recover the topology of a bounded planar region (with holes) from point samples [23]. Our work
investigates its theoretical properties and generalizes it to settings beyond the planar case.
Given a graph G on a set of points P equipped with a metric, one can build a graph induced complex on a subsample
Q ⊆ P as follows. A simplex is in the complex if and only if its vertex set V ⊆ Q has the property that a set of points in
P , each being closest to exactly one vertex in V , forms a clique in G. Fig. 1 shows a graph induced complex for a set of
data points in the plane. Subsampled points are the darker vertices. Input points are grouped according to the proximity to
the subsampled vertices (indicated with a Voronoi partition). The shaded triangle enlarged on the right-hand side is in the
graph induced complex since there is a 3-clique in the input graph whose 3 vertices have 3 different closest point in the
subsample. Observe that, in this example, the graph induced complex has the same homology as the sampled space.
Fig. 2 shows experimental results on two data sets, 40,000 sample points from a Klein bottle in R4 and 15,000 sample
points from the primary circle of natural image data considered in R25 [1]. The graphs connecting any two points within
α = 0.05 unit distance for Klein bottle and α = 0.6 unit distance for the primary circle were taken as input for the graph
induced complexes. The 2-skeleton of the Rips complexes for these α parameters have 608,200 and 1,329,672,867 simplices
respectively. These sizes are too large to carry out fast computations.
For comparison, we constructed the graph induced complex, sparsiﬁed Rips complex, and the witness complex on the
same subsample determined by a parameter δ . The parameter δ is also used in the graph induced complex (see deﬁnitions
later) and the witness complex. The edges in the Rips complex built on the same subsample were of lengths at most α + 2δ
(justiﬁed by Proposition 2.8). We varied δ and observed the rank of the one dimensional homology group (β1 ). The plots
show that the graph induced complex captured β1 correctly for a signiﬁcantly wider range of δ (left plots) while its size
remained comparable to that of the witness complex (right plots). In some cases, the graph induced complex could capture
the correct β1 with remarkably small number of simplices. For example, it had β1 = 2 for Klein bottle when there were
278 simplices for δ = 0.7 and 154 simplices for δ = 1.0. In both cases β1 for Rips and witness complexes did not match
with that of the sampled spaces while the Rips complex had a much larger size (loge scale plot) and the witness complex
had comparable size. This illustrates why the graph induced complex can be a better choice than the Rips and witness
complexes.
We establish three different results. First, we show that the one-dimensional homology group of surfaces in three
dimensions can be determined by graph induced complexes. Even the surface itself can be reconstructed with some
post-processing from a sparse subsample of a sample that could be excessively dense. Second, we show that, for higherdimensional manifolds, one-dimensional homology can still be determined from graph induced complexes with a simple
modiﬁcation of the metric. Finally, we extend our results to other homology groups where we show that the persistent homology groups of a pair of graph induced complexes can determine the homology groups of compact spaces. Experimental
results support our theory.

2. Graph induced complex and preliminaries
First we deﬁne the graph induced complex in a more abstract setting which does not require a metric.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G ( V ) be a graph with the vertex set V and let ν : V → V be a vertex map where ν ( V ) = V ⊆ V . The
graph induced complex G (G ( V ), V , ν ) is deﬁned as the simplicial complex where a k-simplex σ = { v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k+1 } is in
G ( V , V , ν ) if and only if there exists a (k + 1)-clique { v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v k+1 } ⊆ V so that ν ( v i ) = v i for each i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k + 1}.
To see that it is indeed a simplicial complex, observe that a subset of a clique is also a clique.
Now we specialize the graph induced complex to the case where the vertices of the input graph come from a metric
space.
Deﬁnition 2.2. A metric space ( X , d) is a pair where X is a set and d : X × X → R+ is a distance function satisfying
d(x, y ) ≥ 0, d(x, y ) = 0 iff x = y, d(x, y ) = d( y , x), and d(x, y ) ≤ d(x, z) + d( z, y ).
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let ( P , d) be a metric space where P is a ﬁnite point set and let Q ⊂ P be a subset. Let νd : P → Q denote
the nearest point map where νd ( p ) is a point in argminq∈ Q d( p , q). Given a graph G ( P ) with vertex set P , we deﬁne its
graph induced complex as G (G ( P ), Q , d) := G (G ( P ), Q , νd ).
Among the many possible choices for d, we will focus on two cases where d = d E , the Euclidean distance, and d = d G , the
graph distance induced by the graph G ( P ) assuming its edges have non-negative weights. For any two vertices p 1 , p 2 ∈ P ,
the distance d G ( p 1 , p 2 ) is the length of the shortest path between p 1 and p 2 in G ( P ). We will describe the choices of the
distance functions when necessary.
In our case, the point set P will be a discrete subset of a compact smooth manifold M ⊂ Rn without boundary, or of a
compact set X ⊂ Rn . The graph G ( P ) will be the graph G α ( P ) = ( P , E α ) where ( p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ E α if and only if p 1 − p 2 ≤ α .
The graph induced complex induced by G α ( P ) on a subset Q ⊆ P under a distance function d will be the focus of our
study. To emphasize the dependence on the parameter α , we write it as G α ( P , Q , d) := G (G α ( P ), Q , d). Notice that G α ( P )

578

is induced by Euclidean metric whereas d is used to deﬁne the nearest point map in constructing G α ( P , Q , d). As mentioned
earlier, the graph induced complex bears a similarity to the complex considered in [18,23]. One may also draw a parallel
between the graph induced complexes and the well-known witness complexes [12] where P acts as a witness set W and
Q acts as a landmark set L ⊆ W . However, the analogy does not extend any further since the construction of the witness
complex and its variants [4] differs from that of the graph induced complex. For example, the original witness complex
deﬁned in [12] includes a k-simplex with vertex set in L only if its vertices belong to the k-nearest neighbors of a point in
W . In contrast the graph induced complex includes a k-simplex only if its vertices have nearest neighbors in W that form a
k-clique in a graph built on the vertices belonging to W . Similar to the witness complex, the graph induced complex builds
upon a subsampling, but, unlike the witness complex, it enjoys some topological properties without any extra modiﬁcations
such as weighting [4].
2.1. Sampling, homology, and sandwiching
As indicated before, the input point set P is a sample of a smooth manifold M or a compact set X embedded in
Euclidean space. We will also subsample P according to a distance function d. Therefore, we deﬁne sampling in a more
general context.
Deﬁnition 2.4. A ﬁnite set P ⊆ X is an ε -sample of a metric space ( X , d), if for each point x ∈ X there is a point p ∈ P so
that d(x, p ) ≤ ε . Additionally, P is called δ -sparse if d( p 1 , p 2 ) ≥ δ for any pair of points in P .
The point set P does not have interesting topology by itself. We build simplicial complexes using P as the vertex set to
infer the topology of the sampled space X . Speciﬁcally, our goal is to infer the homology groups of a manifold or a compact
set from which P is sampled by computing the homology groups of a simplicial complex built with P as vertices. Let Hr (·)
denote the r-dimensional homology group. It refers to the singular homology when the domain is a manifold or a compact
set, and to the simplicial homology when it is a simplicial complex. Also, all homology groups are assumed to be deﬁned
over the ﬁnite ﬁeld Z2 .
Our main tool for topological inference rests on the relationship between the graph induced complexes and the Rips
complexes that are known to capture information about the homology groups of spaces [3,21].
Deﬁnition 2.5. Given a point set P ⊆ Rn and a parameter α , the Rips complex Rα ( P ) = Rα ( P , d E ) is a simplicial complex
where a simplex σ belongs to Rα ( P ) if and only if all vertices of σ , drawn from P , are within α Euclidean distance of each
other.
Notice that we deﬁne Rips complexes with Euclidean distances instead of general metrics which will be assumed throughout
this paper. It is known that such Rips complexes capture the topology of a manifold M if the parameters are chosen right [3,
21]. We utilize this fact to infer H1 ( M ) by exploiting a sandwiching property of graph induced complexes by Rips complexes.
To prove this fact, we recall the concept of contiguous maps from algebraic topology. Our main interest in this concept is
the fact that two contiguous maps between two simplicial complexes induce the same homomorphism at the homology
level.
Deﬁnition 2.6. (See [22].) Let K1 and K2 be two simplicial complexes connected by two simplicial maps a : K1 → K2 and
b : K1 → K2 . We say a and b are contiguous, if and only if for any simplex σ ∈ K1 , the simplices a(σ ) and b(σ ) are faces
of a common simplex in K2 .
Fact 2.7. (See [22].) If a : K1 → K2 and b : K1 → K2 are contiguous, then the induced homomorphisms a∗ : Hr (K1 ) → Hr (K2 ) and
b∗ : Hr (K1 ) → Hr (K2 ) are equal.
In our case two simplicial complexes will be K1 = Rα ( P ) and K2 = Rβ ( P ) for some β > α . The map a is an inclusion
Rα ( P ) → Rβ ( P ). For the map b, we consider a simplicial map h : Rα ( P ) → G α ( P , Q , d) which composed with an inclusion
G α ( P , Q , d) → Rβ ( P ) provides b. We elaborate on this construction.
The vertex sets of Rα ( P ) and G α ( P , Q , d) are P and Q respectively with a vertex map νd : P → Q where p ∈ P maps to
one of its closest point(s) νd ( p ) ∈ Q . Observe that G α ( P ) is the 1-skeleton of Rα ( P ). Therefore, the edges of a (k + 1)-clique
in G α ( P ) constitute the 1-skeleton of a k-simplex in Rα ( P ) and vice versa. The vertex map νd extends to a simplicial map
h : Rα ( P ) → G α ( P , Q , d) where a k-simplex { p 1 , p 2 , · · · , pk+1 } in Rα ( P ) is mapped to a simplex (of dimension at most k)
with the vertex set {νd ( p i )}. To see that h is well deﬁned, observe that any subset of the (k + 1)-clique { p 1 , p 2 , · · · , pk+1 } is
also a clique in G α ( P ) and hence {νd ( p i )} is a simplex in G α ( P , Q , d). The following result is used later.
Proposition 2.8. Let ( P , d) be a metric space where P ⊂ Rn is a ﬁnite set and for every pair p 1 , p 2 ∈ P , d( p 1 , p 2 ) is at least the
Euclidean distance p 1 − p 2 . Let Q be a δ -sample of ( P , d). We have the sequence

j

Rα ( P ) −→ G α ( P , Q , d) → Rα +2δ ( P )
where j is an inclusion and j ◦ h is contiguous to the inclusion i : Rα ( P ) → Rα +2δ ( P ). Hence, j ∗ ◦ h∗ = i ∗ .
Proof. The map h is well-deﬁned as we detailed before. We observe that G α ( P , Q , d) ⊆ Rα +2δ ( P ) because, by triangle
inequality, any edge (q1 , q2 ) of a simplex σ ∈ G α ( P , Q , d) satisﬁes d(q1 , q2 ) ≤ α + 2δ . Since d(q1 , q2 ) ≥ q1 − q2 by assumption, the edge (q1 , q2 ) and hence the simplex σ are in Rα +2δ ( P ). It follows that the inclusion map j is well-deﬁned.
To prove the contiguity, consider a simplex σ in Rα ( P ). We need to show that the vertices of σ and h(σ ) span a simplex
in Rα +2δ ( P ). Clearly, all vertices of σ are within α distance of each other. By deﬁnition of h, all vertices of h(σ ) are within
distance α + 2δ . Let u be a vertex of σ and h( v ) be a vertex of h(σ ) where v is a vertex of σ . Then the Euclidean distance
u − h( v ) is at most u − v + v − h( v ) ≤ α + δ . Therefore, all vertices of σ and h(σ ) are within α + 2δ distance. Hence,
the simplex σ and h(σ ) are faces of a common simplex in Rα +2δ ( Q ) proving the claim of contiguity. ✷
Computing graph induced complexes One may wonder how to eﬃciently construct the graph induced complexes in practice.
Our experiments show that the following procedure runs quite eﬃciently in practice. It takes advantage of computing
nearest neighbors within a range and, more importantly, computing cliques only in a sparsiﬁed graph.
Let the ball B (q, δ) in metric d be called the δ -cover for the point q. A graph induced complex G α ( P , Q , d) where Q
is a δ -sparse δ -sample can be built easily by identifying δ -covers with a rather standard iterative algorithm similar to the
greedy (farthest point) iterative algorithm of [20]. Let Q i = {q1 , . . . , qi } be the point set sampled so far from P . We maintain
the invariants (i) Q i is δ -sparse and (ii) every point p ∈ P that are in the union of δ -covers q∈ Q i B (q, δ) have their closest
point ν ( p ) = argminq∈ Q i d( p , q) in Q i identiﬁed. To augment Q i to Q i +1 = Q i ∪ {qi +1 }, we choose a point q i +1 ∈ P that
is outside the δ -covers q∈ Q i B (q, δ). Certainly, q i +1 is at least δ units away from all points in Q i thus satisfying the ﬁrst
invariant. For the second invariant, we check every point p in the δ -cover of q i +1 and update ν ( p ) to be q i +1 if its distance
to qi +1 is smaller than the distance d( p , ν ( p )). At the end, we obtain a sample Q ⊆ P whose δ -covers cover the entire point
set P and thus is a δ -sample of ( P , d) which is also δ -sparse.
Next, we construct the simplices of G α ( P , Q , d). This requires identifying cliques in G α ( P ) that have vertices with
different closest points in Q . We delete every edge pp from G α ( P ) where ν ( p ) = ν ( p ). Then, we determine every clique
{ p 1 , . . . pk } in the remaining sparsiﬁed graph and include the simplex {ν ( p 1 ), . . . , ν ( pk )} in G α ( P , Q , d). The main saving
here is that many cliques of the original graph are removed before it is processed for clique computation. We use the
recently proposed simplex tree which computes cliques eﬃciently both time and space-wise [5].
3. Surface point data
In this section, we infer the geometry and topology of a surface through the graph induced complex. Let M be a smooth,
compact, connected surface embedded in R3 that has no boundary. We assume that M has positive reach ρ = ρ ( M ) which
is the minimum distance of M to its medial axis. Let P be an ε -sample of the metric space ( M , d E ) where d E is the
Euclidean distance. Consider the graph induced complex G α ( P , Q , d E ). In this section, the subset Q ⊂ P is assumed to be a
δ -sparse δ -sample of ( P , d E ).
Our result in this section is that under certain conditions on α , ε and δ , G α ( P , Q , d E ) captures the homology of M
and contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation Del| M Q as deﬁned below. The sparsity of Q turns out to be a crucial
condition in the argument.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let Del Q denote the Delaunay triangulation of a point set Q ⊂ R3 . The restricted Delaunay triangulation of
Q with respect to a manifold M ⊂ R3 , denoted Del| M Q , is deﬁned to be the subcomplex of Del Q formed by all Delaunay
simplices whose Voronoi duals intersect M.

Consider the sequence Rα ( P ) −→ G α ( P , Q , d) → Rα +2δ ( P ) in Proposition 2.8. When P , an ε -sample of ( M , d E ), is
suﬃciently dense, it is known that i ∗ : H1 (Rα ( P )) → H1 (Rβ ( P )) is an isomorphism for appropriate α and β . The homomorphism h∗ is injective if i ∗ is an isomorphism since i ∗ = j ∗ ◦ h∗ . If we can show that h∗ is also surjective, then h∗ is
an isomorphism. We now show that h∗ is indeed surjective for H1 -homology and hence information about H1 ( M ) can be
obtained by computing H1 (G α ( P , Q , d E )). First, we observe the following. Let P q ⊆ P be the points who have q ∈ Q as the
closest point. Notice that by the deﬁnition of h, h( P q ) = {q}. To prove that h∗ is surjective, it is suﬃcient to prove that the
preimage of each 1-cycle in G α ( P , Q , d E ) contains a 1-cycle of Rα ( P ). This, in turn, is true if the 1-skeleton of Rα ( P q ) is
connected.
Proposition 3.2. If the 1-skeleton of Rα ( P q ) is connected for all q ∈ Q , then h∗ is surjective.

Fig. 3. In a long thin Voronoi cell, Bq may be disconnected and may not contain M q .

Proof. We show that the chain map h# induced by the simplicial map h is surjective. It follows that the homomorphism h∗
induced at the homology level is also surjective. Let c = q0 q1 + q1 q2 + · · · + qk q0 be any 1-cycle in G α ( P , Q , d E ). The edges
qi −1 qi and qi qi +1 have edges, say p i −1 p i and p i p i +1 respectively, in their preimage under h in Rα ( P ). Consider a path γi
between p i and p i in Rα ( P qi ) where h( p i ) = h( p i ) = qi . Such a path exists because Rα ( P q ) is connected for all q ∈ Q . We
have a 1-cycle

c = p 0 p 1 + γ1 + p 1 p 2 + γ2 + p 2 p 3 + · · · + γk + pk p 0 + γ0
in Rα ( P ) so that h# (c ) = c. This shows that h∗ is surjective in the ﬁrst homology group.
The 1-skeleton of Rα ( P q ) is connected if the union of balls Bq =

B ( p , α2 ) is connected because an edge p 1 p 2 is

in Rα ( P q ) if the respective balls B ( p 1 , α2 ) and B ( p 2 , α2 ) intersect. Let V q be the Voronoi cell of q in the Voronoi diagram

Vor Q . Let M q = V q ∩ M be the restricted Voronoi region. It turns out (we will prove it later in Proposition 3.4) that if M q
is contained in Bq and M q is connected, then Bq is connected. It may seem a priori that Bq would contain M q if P is a
dense sample. Unfortunately, that is not true as Fig. 3 illustrates. To avoid such a case, we require that the Voronoi cells
do not subtend very small angles between their facets which is ensured by the δ -sparsity of Q . Proposition 3.3 below uses
δ -sparsity in a subtle way to prepare for the proof that Bq contains M q . This result will also be used later to show that the
graph induced complex G α ( P , Q , d E ) in fact contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation Del| M Q .
For a simplex σ ∈ Del| M Q , we call a ball B (c , r ) a surface Delaunay ball of σ if c ∈ M and its boundary contains the
vertices of σ .
Proposition 3.3. Let P be an ε -sample of ( M , d E ), and Q a δ -sparse δ -sample of ( P , d E ). Let σ ∈ Del| M Q be a restricted Delaunay

triangle or edge with a vertex q ∈ Q . Let c be the center of a surface Delaunay ball of σ . If 8ε ≤ δ ≤ 27
ρ ( M ), then there is a point
p ∈ P so that p ∈ B (c , 4ε ) and q is the closest point to p among all points in Q .
Proof. See Appendix A for the proof.

We can now present the main result of this subsection.
Theorem 3.5. Let P be an ε -sample of a smooth compact surface M embedded in R3 , and Q ⊆ P a δ -sparse δ -sample of ( P , d E ).

Proof. Since δ ≤ 0.18ρ , we can assume each restricted Voronoi cell M q to be path connected [13]. This together with the
lower bound on α imply that Rα ( P q ) is connected for each q ∈ Q thanks to Proposition 3.4. Consequently, Proposition 3.2
establishes that h∗ is surjective.

Rδ ( P ) → Rα ( P ) → Rα +2δ ( P ) → R3α ( P ).
By Eq. (1), we have that the composition of inclusions i ◦ i 1 : Rδ ( P ) → Rα +2δ ( P ) induces an isomorphism at the homology
level. Hence i ∗ is necessarily surjective. On the other hand, the composition of inclusions i 2 ◦ i : Rα ( P ) → R3α ( P ) induces an
isomorphism at the homology level. Hence i ∗ is necessarily injective. Putting these two together, we have that i ∗ is indeed
an isomorphism. Therefore h∗ is injective by Proposition 2.8. It then follows that h∗ is an isomorphism as claimed. ✷
Notice that the lower bound on δ in Theorem 3.5 is not restricted by α . This means that one can have a dense input
graph for a large α whose connectivity does not restrict the size of the subsample.
In the next subsection, we show two examples of surface data where the graph induced complex has the correct
H1 -homology with a considerably fewer simplices than the ν -witness complex, a modiﬁed witness complex suggested in [4]
for capturing the topology correctly.
3.2. Reconstruction of M using G α ( P , Q , d E )
In this subsection, we observe that the graph induced complexes can also be used for surface reconstruction. It is known
that if P is dense and T is a simplicial complex with vertex set P which satisﬁes the following conditions, a simplicial
manifold can be extracted from T that is homeomorphic to M [2,13]. The conditions are: (i) T is embedded in R3 , (ii) all
triangles in T have small circumradii compared to reach and (iii) T contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation. We show
that G α ( P , Q , d E ) contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation. We then prune G α ( P , Q , d E ) so that conditions (i) and (ii)
are satisﬁed, but none of the restricted Delaunay triangles are deleted in the process which then ensures condition (iii).
2
Theorem 3.6. For 8ε ≤ δ ≤ 27
ρ and α ≥ 8ε , we have that Del|M Q ⊆ G α ( P , Q , d E ) where P is an ε -sample of ( M , d E ) and Q ⊆ P
is a δ -sparse δ -sample of ( P , d E ).
2
Proof. We will show that if 8ε ≤ δ ≤ 27
ρ and α ≥ 8ε , then any triangle σ ∈ Del|M Q is in G α ( P , Q , d E ). The theorem
follows from this.
Let σ = {q1 , q2 , q3 }, and c the center of a surface Delaunay ball of σ . By Proposition 3.3, there exists a point p i ∈ P in
B (c , 4ε ) so that q i is the closest point in Q to p i for i = 1, 2, 3. It turns out that the interior of bounded cones used in the
proof of Proposition 3.3 for q1 , q2 and q3 are disjoint. Hence each point p i found in B (c , 4ε ) corresponding to q i is distinct
from the other two. Therefore, if α ≥ 8ε , the vertices p 1 , p 2 and p 3 form a clique in G α ( P ) and hence the triangle σ is in
G α ( P , Q , d E ). ✷

The complex G α ( P , Q , d E ) may have intersecting triangles. We prune G α ( P , Q , d E ) to eliminate all such pairwise intersections while leaving the restricted Delaunay triangles in the complex. This ensures that the resulting complex embeds in
R3 and still contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation. Our simple observation is that if two intersecting triangles t 1 and
t 2 do not intersect in a common face, one can decide locally which of the two can possibly be in a Delaunay triangulation.
Observation 3.7. If V is the vertex set of two intersecting triangles t 1 and t 2 whose intersection is not a common face of both, then at
least one of t 1 and t 2 is not in Del V . The triangle which is not in Del V cannot be in Del P where V ⊆ P .
One can check locally the Delaunay condition for t 1 and t 2 and decide to throw away at least one triangle which is not in
Del V . This takes only constant time since V contains at most 6 vertices. Notice that no restricted Delaunay triangle can
be thrown away by this process. After repeatedly pruning away one of the pairwise intersecting triangles, we arrive at a
complex that embeds in R3 and contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation Del| M Q . Next, we prune all triangles that
have circumradius more than 2δ . Again, since the surface Delaunay ball of each restricted Delaunay triangle has circumradius
at most δ + ε ≤ 2δ , one is ensured that no restricted Delaunay triangle is eliminated. Assuming δ to be suﬃciently small,

a sharp edge pruning and a walk on the outside of the resulting complex as described in [2,13] provides the reconstructed
surface. The output surface has one nice property that the triangles have bounded aspect ratios since their circumradii are
at most 2δ and their edge lengths are at least δ ( Q is δ -sparse).
2
Theorem 3.8. Let M ⊂ R3 be a smooth, compact, and connected surface. If 8ε ≤ δ ≤ 27
ρ , α ≥ 8ε , P is an ε -sample of ( M , d E ), and
Q ⊆ P is a δ -sparse δ -sample of ( P , d E ), then a triangulation T ⊆ G α ( P , Q , d E ) of M can be computed where each triangle in T has
a bounded aspect ratio.

We observe in experiments that surfaces can be reconstructed from a very sparse subsample with this strategy. Fig. 4
presents two examples for surface reconstruction. The original sample P has 1,575,055 points for the Fertility model and
1,049,892 points for Botijo model. The input graphs for the graph induced complex are constructed by connecting two
points within distance of α = 0.45 for Fertility and α = 1.0 for Botijo. The 2-skeleton of the Rips complex built on the
input graph has 45,788,607 simplices for Fertility and 91,264,091 simplices for Botijo. The subsample Q consists of 3007
points for Fertility with δ = 3.68, and 4659 points for Botijo with δ = 4.0. The graph induced complex G α ( P , Q , d E ) built
on the subsample has: 3007 vertices, 9178 edges, 6304 triangles, 139 tetrahedra and no other higher dimensional simplices
for Fertility; 4659 vertices, 14,709 edges, 10,755 triangles, 718 tetrahedra, 5 4-dimensional simplices, and no other higher
dimensional simplices for Botijo. The reconstructed surfaces from G α ( P , Q , d E ) are shown in Fig. 4. For Fertility, it has
3007 vertices, 9039 edges and 6026 triangles; for Botijo, it has 4659 vertices, 14,001 edges and 9334 triangles. Evidently,
the graph induced complex has only a few more simplices compared to the reconstructed surface.
For a comparison, we also constructed the ν -witness complex suggested in [4] which also contains the restricted Delaunay triangulation Del| M Q with ν = (1, 6, 6, 4). The ν -witness complex for Fertility has 3007 vertices, 35,687 edges,
119,237 triangles and 19,874 tetrahedra; the ν -witness complex for Botijo has 4659 vertices, 54,648 edges, 180,936 triangles and 29,654 tetrahedra. The graph induced complex has much smaller size, but still captures β1 (β1 = 8 for the Fertility,
and β1 = 10 for the Botijo).
4. Point data for more general domains
In this section, we consider domains beyond surfaces in R3 .
4.1. Manifolds
Let M be a k-manifold embedded in Rn and let P be a discrete sample of ( M , d E ). We observe that the overall setup in
Section 3.1 for inferring H1 -homology from the graph induced complex generalizes easily to higher dimensions. The inclusion map Rα ( P ) → Rα +2δ ( P ) still induces an isomorphism at the homology level if α and δ are chosen appropriately. In
that case, the map h∗ : H1 (Rα ( P )) → H1 (G α ( P , Q , d)) remains injective by the same argument as before. The main trouble
arises when we try to prove that it is also surjective. Observe that, to prove the surjectivity of h∗ , we used the fact that the
restricted Voronoi cell M q = V q ∩ M in Vor Q is connected (Proposition 3.4). Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true in
high dimensions given the counterexamples in [4,10]. To overcome this impediment we change the distance function replacing the Euclidean distance with the graph distance while building G α ( P , Q , d). Speciﬁcally, we still consider G α ( P ) to be
the graph connecting points in P with Euclidean distance α or less, but take Q to be a δ -sparse δ -sample of ( P , d G ) where
the graph distance d G = d G α ( P ) is deﬁned with the Euclidean lengths as the edge weights. Then, we consider G α ( P , Q , d G ).

As before, let P q ⊆ P be the set of points nearest to a point q ∈ Q with respect to d G . Observe that any point in P that
is on the shortest path between q and a point p ∈ P q also belongs to P q . This immediately allows us to claim that the
1-skeleton of Rα ( P q ) is connected, which was needed to claim that h∗ is surjective.
Proposition 4.1. Rα ( P q ) is connected, and thus h∗ is surjective.

ρ , the map h∗ : H1 (Rα ( P )) → H1 (G α ( P , Q , dG )) is an isomorphism where h : Rα ( P ) → G α ( P , Q , dG ) is the

simplicial map induced by the nearest point map νdG : P → Q .
4.2. A leaner subsampling for H1
In this subsection we show that the subsample Q can be made leaner. The main insight is that we can deﬁne a feature
size larger than the reach which permits us to subsample more sparsely with respect to this larger feature size. Gao et
al. [23] considered a similar feature size for the same reason of requiring sparser sampling for a two dimensional shape. Here
we show that such a sparser sample is also adequate for determining H1 of manifolds in high dimensions. Our experimental
results in Fig. 2 suggest that one can obtain information about H1 from a very sparse sample in practice.
Let K be a simplicial complex with non-negative weights on its edges. We deﬁne homological loop feature size as

hlfs(K) =

1
inf{|c | : c is non-null-homologous 1-cycle in K}
2
∞ if no such c exists.

This feature size is very similar to the systolic feature size sfs( X , d) of a compact metric space ( X , d) [23] which is the length
of the shortest non-contractible loop in X . Our deﬁnition of hlfs when applied to a metric space ( X , d) becomes larger than
or equal to sfs( X , d). Notice that every loop of K with length less than 2hlfs(K) is null-homologous in K.
Let Q ⊆ P be a δ -sample of ( P , d G ) as before but with δ ≤ 12 hlfs(Rα ( P )) − 12 α . Let h : Rα ( P ) → G α ( P , Q , d G ) be the
simplicial map as deﬁned earlier. We aim to show that the induced homomorphism h∗ on the ﬁrst homology is injective.
Since we use graph distances, Proposition 4.1 remains valid and hence h∗ remains to be surjective. However, we cannot
claim i ∗ : H1 (Rα ( P )) → H1 (Rα +2δ ( P )) is an isomorphism because δ could be larger than required. Thus, we cannot use i ∗
to infer that h∗ is injective as before. Nevertheless, we can prove the following result using a different approach.

Proof. We only need to show that h∗ is injective, as its surjectivity follows from Proposition 4.1. To show the injectivity, it
suﬃces to show that h∗ has a trivial kernel. Let σ be any triangle in G α ( P , Q , d G ). If under the chain map h# , every cycle
in the preimage of the boundary cycle ∂ σ is null homologous, then every null homologous cycle in G α ( P , Q , d G ) has only
null homologous cycles in its preimage. This is true due to the fact that a bounded cycle is a sum of boundaries of triangles
and the chain map h# is surjective (see the proof of Proposition 3.2). Below, we show that under the chain map h# , every
cycle in the preimage of the boundary cycle of any triangle indeed is null homologous. It would then follow that the kernel
of h∗ is trivial.
−1
Let γ be any cycle in the preimage of ∂ σ . We have γ ∈ uv ∈∂ σ h#
(uv ) where uv be any edge of σ . Let γuv be any
maximal subpath of γ so that h# (γuv ) = uv (Fig. 5(a)). For each such γuv , we construct a cycle uv so that uv is null

584

homologous and γ is homologous to
uv . Therefore, showing γ is null homologous reduces to showing that every uv is
null-homologous.
We construct uv as follows. By the construction of G α ( P , Q , d G ), there is a triangle abc ∈ Rα ( P ) such that h(abc ) = σ
with h(a) = u, h(b) = v. Consider the shortest paths π (u , a) and π ( v , b) in G α ( P ) from u to a and from v to b respectively.
Observe that all vertices in π (u , a) and π ( v , b) are mapped to u and v respectively by h since we are using the graphinduced distance d G to construct G α ( P , Q , d G ). Take uv to be the chain π (u , a) + ab + π ( v , b) + γuv ; refer to Fig. 5(a). With
this choice, we have γ =
uv + ∂(abc ) and hence γ is homologous to
uv as promised. To prove uv null-homologous,
we construct a homologous path γˆuv to γuv which gives a homologous cycle ˆuv to uv . We then prove that ˆuv is nullhomologous.
Call an edge e = (x, y ) in Rα ( P ) bicolored if its two end-points are mapped to two distinct vertices by h; otherwise, e is
unicolored. A 1-chain from Rα ( P ) is unicolored if it has only unicolored edges. For simplicity, we assume that vertices from
γuv are all contained in h−1 (u ) ∪ h−1 ( v ) because γuv is always homologous to a path containing vertices mapped only to
u or v. In this case, γuv can be decomposed into a set of bicolored edges { y 0 x1 , y 1 x2 , . . . , yk−1 xk } together with a set of
unicolored chains {γ0 , γ1 , . . . , γk } such that ∂ γi = xi + y i . In particular, γuv can be written as

γuv = γ0 + y 0 x1 + γ1 + y 1 x2 + · · · + yk−1 xk + γk .

(2)

See Fig. 5(b) for an illustration.
Claim 4.4. Let γi be a unicolored chain with two boundary points xi , y i so that for any simplex τ ∈ γi , h(τ ) = u. Then, γi is homologous
to the chain γˆi = π (xi , u ) + π (u , y i ).
Given the chain

γuv with subchains γi as in Eq. (2), we convert it to a homologous chain

γˆuv = γˆ0 + y 0 x1 + γˆ1 + · · · + yk−1 xk + γˆk .
Replace γuv with γˆuv in uv to obtain a homologous cycle ˆuv ; refer to Fig. 5. Observe that ˆuv is the sum of cycles
(diamonds) that have two unicolored chains and two bicolored edges as shown in Fig. 5(d). Such a cycle c has length at
most 4δ + 2α . This is because each unicolored chain in c has at most two shortest paths of the form π (u , xi ) and π (u , y i )
(or π ( v , xi ) and π ( v , y i )) that have lengths 2δ or less ( Q is a δ -sample of ( P , d G )), and the two bicolored edges have
lengths at most 2α in G α ( P ). The cycle c is null homologous because its length is

|c | ≤ 4δ + 2α < 2hlfs(Rα ( P )),

given that δ <

hlfs(Rα ( P )) −

α.

It follows that ˆuv is null homologous.
We only need to show Claim 4.4 to ﬁnish the proof. Let xi = p 0 , p 1 , · · · , pm = y i be the sequence of vertices on the
unicolored chain (path) γi . Consider the shortest paths π ( p i , u ) for each p i on this path. The length of the cycle zi =
π (u , p i ) + p i p i+1 + π (u , p i+1 ) is at most 2δ + α for each i ∈ [0, m − 1]. Therefore, it is null homologous by our assumption.
m−1
We have γi + γˆi = i −0 zi = 0. Therefore, γi and γˆi are homologous. ✷
Notice that, we can use Theorem 4.3 to compute H1 ( M ) for a manifold M from a much leaner subsample than predicted
by Theorem 3.5. It is known that, for an ε -sample P of M, the shortest non-trivial 1-cycle in Rα ( P ) has a length which is
at least a constant times the length of the shortest non-trivial 1-cycle of H1 ( M ); see Theorem 3.11 in [15] for details. This
means that a δ -sample of P where δ is at most some constant fraction of the shortest non-trivial 1-cycle of M is suﬃcient
to build the graph induced complex from Rα ( P ) to infer H1 ( M ).
4.3. Point data for compact sets
So far we have focused on H1 -homology. In this section we extend the domain to compact subspaces of Euclidean spaces
and consider homology groups of all dimensions. This generality comes at the expense of additional computations. Unlike
previous approaches that allow us to infer the H1 -homology of the sampled manifold by computing directly the same for
the graph induced complexes, now we need to compute the persistent homology [17] induced by simplicial maps. The
well-known algorithms for computing persistent homology [17] work for maps induced by inclusions. In a contemporary
paper [14], we present an algorithm that can compute the persistent homology induced by simplicial maps.
Let X ⊂ Rn be a compact set and X λ be its offset with λ > 0. Since it is diﬃcult to compute Hk ( X ) from a sample [9],
we aim for computing the homology groups Hk ( X λ ) for the offset X λ . Let wfs( X ) denote the weak feature size which is
deﬁned as the smallest positive critical value of the distance function to X [8]. We prove that the persistent homology
of the graph induced complex deﬁned with either Euclidean or graph distance d provides the correct homology of X λ
where 0 < λ < wfs( X ). Speciﬁcally, the image of h∗ : Hk (G α ( P , Q , d)) → Hk (G α ( P , Q , d)) induced by a simplicial map
h : G α ( P , Q , d) → G α ( P , Q , d) becomes isomorphic to Hk ( X λ ) for appropriate α and α . It is worth noting that the lower
bound on α for which we prove this result depends only on the density ε of the input P and not on the density of the

subsampled set Q . This is in contrast with a similar result for witness complexes presented in [9]. We recall the following
result from [9].
Proposition 4.5. If the sequence of homomorphisms A → B → C → D → E → F between ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces satisﬁes
that rank( A → F ) = rank(C → D ), then rank( B → E ) = rank(C → D ).
Let Q and Q be subsamples of P where Q is a δ -sparse δ -sample and Q is a δ -sparse δ -sample for δ > δ . Consider
the interleaving sequence between the graph induced and Rips complexes,

where i 1 , i 2 , i 3 , j 1 and j 2 are inclusions and h = h2 ◦ i 2 ◦ j 1 . By Proposition 2.8, h1 and h2 are simplicial maps. Therefore, h
is also a simplicial map as composition of simplicial maps. In particular, h is the simplicial map induced by the vertex map
that maps each point q ∈ Q to its closest point q ∈ Q in Q . We prove that im h∗ ∼
= Hk ( X λ ) where h∗ : Hk (G α ( P , Q , d)) →
Hk (G 4(α +2δ) ( P , Q , d)) and ε , α and δ fall in appropriate ranges.
Theorem 4.6. Let X ⊂ Rn be a compact space. Let 0 < ε < 19 wfs( X ) and P be an ε -sample of ( X , d E ). Let Q be a δ -sparse δ -sample
of ( P , d) and Q be a δ -sparse δ -sample of ( P , d), where d is either Euclidean or graph distance and δ > δ .
If 2ε ≤ α ≤ 14 (wfs( X ) − ε ) and (α + 2δ) + 12 δ ≤ 14 (wfs( X ) − ε ), then im h∗ ∼
= Hk ( X λ ) (0 < λ < wfs( X )) where h∗ :
Hk (G α ( P , Q , d)) → Hk (G 4(α +2δ) ( P , Q , d)) is induced by h in diagram (3).

Proof. The diagram (3) is not commutative in general. However, it is commutative at the homology level. Proposition 2.8
makes the two triangles at the left and right commutative. The middle square commutes by deﬁnition of h. Now consider

im (i 3 ◦ i 2 ◦ i 1 )∗ ∼

by Theorem 3.6 of [9]. Considering the diagram (3) and the sequence in (4) we have

5. Conclusions
In this work, we investigated the graph induced complex that can be built upon a given point cloud data and a suitable
graph connecting them. This complex, to some extent, has the advantages of both Rips and witness complexes. We have
identiﬁed several of its topological properties that can evidently be useful in extracting information from point data even in
high dimensions.
In Section 4.3, we showed how to infer the homology groups of a compact set using the persistent homology of a pair of
graph induced complexes constructed with two values of δ . One can consider a ﬁltration of G α ( P , Q , d) with Q sparsiﬁed
for increasing values of α and δ . Then, one can obtain a persistence diagram [11] out of this “full ﬁltration” using our
recently proposed algorithm for computing the topological persistence for ﬁltrations connected with simplicial maps [14].
The algorithm will collapse vertices progressing through the ﬁltration and hence will keep the size of the complex in
question contained. Relating this persistence diagram to that of a ﬁltration obtained by a Rips ﬁltration is an interesting
question. We have addressed this question in a subsequent work [14].
Finding other applications where the graph induced complex becomes useful also remains open for further investigations.

Appendix A. Proof of Proposition 3.3
First, we present an elementary geometric result that we need to use in the proof. Let C(o, v , α ) ∈ R3 denote the cone
with apex o, axis in the direction of v and aperture 2α .
Claim A.1. Given a ball B with radius r and center c, let q be an arbitrary point on the boundary of B. Consider the two nested cones

C1 = C(c , cq, α ) and C2 = C(c , cq, 2α ) with the same axis. Let p be any point from the intersection of the ball and the inner cone; that
is, p ∈ B ∩ C1 . Let x be an arbitrary point from the boundary of B outside the outer cone; that is, x ∈
/ C2 , and x ∈ ∂ B. Then we have that
p −q < p −x .
Proof. Denote αq := pcq and αx := pcx. Because x is outside of the outer-cone with aperture 4α , and p is inside of the
inner cone of aperture 2α , we have that we have αq < α < αx . Now consider the triangle pcq. By the Cosine Law, we have
that

p −q

Since 0 ≤ αq < αx ≤ π , we have

Now consider the surface Delaunay ball B c = B (c , r ) that passing through the vertices of the simplex σ and containing
no other points from Q . Recall that q is an arbitrary vertex of σ . Since all other vertices of σ are at least δ -Euclidean

Corollary A.2. If there exists a point p ∈ P such that p ∈ B c ∩ C(c , cq, arcsin 2r

p ∈ P , and then we will show that p satisﬁes the requirements of the proposition.
Identifying a point p ∈ P . Let B o = B (m, ρ ) and B o = B (m , ρ ) be two balls tangent to M at c; assume without loss of
generality that B o is inside of M and B o is outside. Locally around c, the surface M is sandwiched between B o and B o . Now
consider the plane P = span{o, o , q}; note that c also lies in P . Denote B c ,P = B c ∩ P , B o,P = B o ∩ P and B o ,P = B o ∩ P .
Let x be the intersection point of B c ,P and B o,P that is on the same side of the line passing through oo as the point q.
Similarly, let y be the intersection point of B c ,P with B o ,P on the same side of the line oo as q. Obviously, q lines on the
arc xy that avoids B o,P and B o ,P . See the right ﬁgure for an illustration where the shaded region is B c ,P . Set θ :=

Now consider the segment cq and the point w ∈ cq such that the length of c w is a value which we will set later. As w
is contained in the cone with apex c and aperture θ in the plane P , the ball B ( w , sin θ) will intersect both segment cx and
c y, thus intersecting both B o and B o . Since B o is inside the surface M and B o outside, it follows that B ( w , sin θ) ∩ M = ∅.
Pick any point p ∈ B ( w , sin θ) ∩ M. By the ε -sampling condition of P , there must exist a sample point p ∈ P such that
p − p ≤ ε . In other words, there is a sample point p ∈ P such that p ∈ B ( w , sin θ + ε ).
The requirements on p We now need to show that the parameter can be chosen such that the point p satisﬁes all the
requirements from the proposition. In particular, we need the following:
C-1 p ∈ B (c , 4ε ); and
C-2 q is the closest point to p among all points in Q .
Now set τ = arcsin sin θ+ε . Obviously, the ball B ( w , sin θ + ε ) (and thus the point p) is contained inside the cone

The existence of a valid
What remains is to ﬁnd a value for
so that (C-1), (C-2.a), and (C-2.b) are all satisﬁed simultaneously. Note that since w − c = , we have that p − c ≤ + sin θ + ε . Hence condition (C-1) is satisﬁed if

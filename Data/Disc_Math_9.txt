Let G∗ , G be finite abelian groups with nontrivial homomorphism group Hom(G∗ , G). Let
Ψ be a non-empty subset of Hom(G∗ , G). Let DΨ (G) denote the minimal integer, such that

any sequence
∑r over G of length DΨ (G) must contain a nontrivial subsequence s1 , . . . , sr ,
such that
i=1 ψi (si ) = 0 for some ψi ∈ Ψ . Let EΨ (G) denote the minimal integer such
that any sequence over G∗ of length EΨ (G) must contain a nontrivial subsequence of length

1. Introduction and main results
We follow the conventions of [6–8] for notation concerning sumsets, sequences and (weighted) subsequence sums over
an abelian group. We provide self-contained definitions for all relevant concepts and the weighted Davenport’s constant in
the subsequent notation section.
Let G be a finite abelian group of order n; Davenport’s constant D(G) of G is defined to be the minimal integer d such
that every sequence over G with length d contains a non-empty subsequence with a zero-sum. Let F (G) denote the free
abelian monoid with basis G written multiplicatively. One of the most difficult open questions in finite group theory is the
determination of a general formula for D(G). Its value also plays an important role in controlling the behavior of factorizations
over Krull monoids.
Another interesting constant E (G) is defined to be the smallest natural number k, such that any sequence of k elements
in G has a subsequence of length |G|, whose sum is zero. In 1995, Gao [4] established the identity
E (G) = D(G) + n − 1,

(1)

which connects these two invariants.
For a finite abelian group G and any non-empty set A ⊂ Z, Adhikari and Chen [1] defined Davenport’s constant of G with
weight A, denoted by DA (G), to be the least natural number k, such that for any sequence (x1 , . . . , xk ) with xi ∈ G, there
∑l
exists a non-empty subsequence (xj1 , . . . , xjl ), and a1 , . . . , al ∈ A, such that i=1 ai xji = 0. Clearly, if G is a cyclic group of
order n, it is equivalent to considering A to be a non-empty subset of {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}, and cases with 0 ∈ A are trivial.
Similarly, for any such set A, for a finite abelian group G of order n, the constant EA (G) is defined to be the least t ∈ N such
that for
∑nall sequences (x1 , . . . , xt ) with xi ∈ G, there exist indices j1 , . . . , jn ∈ N, 1 ≤ j1 < · · · < jn ≤ t, and ϑ1 , . . . , ϑn ∈ A
with i=1 ϑi xji = 0.

For the group G = Z/nZ, we write EA (n) and DA (n) respectively for EA (G) and DA (G). In the cases A = {1}, {−1, 1}, Z⋆n =
{1 ≤ a ≤ n − 1 : gcd(a, n) = 1} or A = (a1 , . . . , ar ) with gcd(a2 − a1 , . . . , ar − a1 , n) = 1 or n = p is a prime, it is proved
that EA (n) = DA (n) + n − 1. In [2,1,10,11], a weighted form of (1) were conjectured: for any non-empty set A ⊂ Z,
EA (n) = DA (n) + n − 1.

(2)

By using the main theorem of Devos et al. [3] and a recently proved theorem of the authors [12], the authors [13]
confirmed (2) in the cyclic case. Recently, Grynkiewicz et al. [8] established (2) for an arbitrary finite abelian group.
(2)
Observe that if G = G1 ⊕ G2 is a direct sum of finite abelian groups, and A is a non-empty subset
∑ of Z = Z ⊕ Z, S =
(s1 , t1 ) · · · (s|S | , t|S | ), si ∈ G1 , tj ∈ G2 is a∑
sequence over G, then we can define the weighted sum n (A, S ) to be all elements
n
g that can be represented as a sum g =
i=1 (ai si , bi ti ) with (s1 , t1 ) · · · (sn , tn ) a subsequence of S and (ai , bi ) ∈ A. Therefore
we can define the related weighted Davenport’s invariant DA (G) and the weighted Erdös–Ginzburg–Ziv invariant EA (G), and
ask if we still have the identity
EA (G) = |G| + DA (G) − 1.
Motivated by the above observations, we define a general weighted subsequence sum and the related weighted
Davenport’s invariant DΨ (G) and the weighted Erdös–Ginzburg–Ziv invariant EΨ (G) in the notation section. Our main results
is as follows.
Theorem 1.1. Let G∗0 , G0 be finite abelian groups, let G ≤ G0 be a subgroup, let α ∈ G0 and Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗0 , G0 ) with Ψ (G∗0 ) ̸= {0}.
Suppose S ∈ F (G∗0 ) is a sequence over G∗0 and ψ(s) ∈ α + G for all ψ ∈ Ψ and s ∈ supp(S ) and |S | ≥ |G| + DΨ (G) − 1. Then
there exist a subgroup H ≤ G, an element β ∈ α + G, and subsequences S1 |S and S2 |S1 such that

Ψ (s) ⊂ β + H for all s ∈ supp(S1 ),

(3)

|S1 | ≥ |H | + DΨ (G) − 1,
|S2 | = |H | + DΨ (H ) − 1,

and

(Ψ (S2 )) = |H |β + H .

(6)

|H |

Suppose |G| ≤ n ≤ |S | − DΨ (G) + 1. Then
∪

(Ψ (S )) is H periodic and contains nβ.

(7)

n

Furthermore, suppose that H is maximal, then

|S1 | ≥ min{|S |, |S | − (|G/H | − 2)}.

(8)

Note that the lower bound EΨ (G) = |G| + DΨ (G) − 1 can be easily seen by considering an extremal sequence of length
DΨ (G) − 1 that avoids representing zero using weights from Ψ concatenated with a sequence of |G| − 1 zeros. We see that
the following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1.1.
Corollary 1.1. Let G∗ , G be finite abelian groups. Let S ∈ F (G∗ ) and Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗ , G) with Ψ (G∗ ) ̸= {0}. If |G| ≤ n ≤
|S | − DΨ (G) + 1. Then there exist some β ∈ G such that:
nβ ∈

∪
−
(Ψ (S )).
n

In particular, if G = G∗ with Ψ (G) ̸= {0}, then
EΨ (G) = |G| + DΨ (G) − 1.
2. Notation
We follow the conventions of [6,8] for notation concerning sequences over an abelian group. Let [a, b] = {k ∈ Z|a ≤
k ≤ b}.
2.1. Groups
Throughout, all abelian groups will be written additively. Let G be an abelian group, and let A, B ⊂ G be non-empty
subsets. Then
A + B = {a + b|a ∈ A, b ∈ B}

denotes their sumset. For g ∈ G, we let g + A = {g + a, a ∈ A}. We use
Stab(A) = {g ∈ G|g + A = A}
to denote the stabilizer of A, and A is called periodic if Stab(A) ̸= {0}, and aperiodic otherwise. If H is a subgroup of an abelian
group G and A is a union of H-cosets, then we say A is H-periodic. And we use

φH : G → G/H
to denote the natural homomorphism modulo H.
Let G0 and G∗0 are finite abelian groups, Hom(G∗0 , G0 ) denotes the set of homomorphisms of G∗0 into G0 . For any non-empty
subset Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗0 , G0 ) and any element x ∈ G∗0 , we denote

Ψ (x) = {ψ(x) : ψ ∈ Ψ } and φH · Ψ = {φH · ψ|ψ ∈ Ψ },
where H < G0 is a subgroup of G0 .
2.2. Sequences
Given a set G, following the tradition, we let F (G) denote the free abelian monoid with basis G written multiplicatively,
and we refer to the elements of F (G) as sequences. We write sequences S ∈ F (G) in the form
S = s1 s2 · · · sr =

∏

g vg ( S ) ,

g ∈G

where vg (S ) ≥ 0 and si ∈ G. We call |S | = r the length of S and vg (S ) the multiplicity of g in S. The support of S is defined
to be supp(S ) := {g ∈ G|vg (S ) > 0}.
A sequence T is called a subsequence of S if T |S in F (G) (equivalently, vg (T ) ≤ vg (S ) for every g ∈ G), and in such case,
we use ST −1 or T −1 S to denote the subsequence of S obtained by removing all terms of T .
2.3. Setpartitions
For a subset G of an abelian group, let S (G) = F (X ), where X is the set of all finite, non-empty subsets of G.
A setpartition over G is a sequence A = A1 A2 · · · An ∈ S (G), where Ai ⊂ G are finite and non-empty. In particular, a
sequence over G can be considered as a setpartition. We call |A| = n the length of A and vA (A) = |{i ∈ [1, |A|]|Ai = A}|
the multiplicity of the subset A in the setpartition A. A setpartition B is called a sub-setpartition of A if B |A in S (G).
Let Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗0 , G0 ), if we have a sequence S = s1 s2 · · · sr ∈ F (G∗0 ), then we can get a setpartition Ψ (S ) corresponding
to S:

Ψ (S ) := Ψ (s1 )Ψ (s2 ) · · · Ψ (sr ).
2.4. Weighted sums
For a subset G of an abelian group, let A = A1 A2 · · · An denote a setpartition over G. We call σ (A) =

∑n

i=1

A.

2.5. Weighted Davenport’s constant and EGZ invariant
Let G∗0 , G0 be two finite abelian groups and G ⊂ G0 be a non-empty subgroup. Let Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗0 , G0 ) with Ψ (G∗0 ) ̸= {0}
(the case that Ψ (G∗0 ) ̸= {0} is trivial), then we define the weighted Davenport’s constant DΨ (G∗0 , G) to be the least positive
∑∪
(Ψ (S )). We often
integer l such that for any sequence S = s1 s2 · · · sn ∈ F (G∗0 ) with n ≥ l and Ψ (si ) ⊂ G, we have 0 ∈
use DΨ (G) to denote DΨ (G∗0 , G) when there is no special constraint for G∗0 .
Similarly, we define the weighted EGZ invariant EΨ (G∗0 , G) to be the least positive integer l such that for any sequence
∑∪
S = s1 s2 · · · sn ∈ F (G∗0 ) with n ≥ l and Ψ (si ) ⊂ G, we have 0 ∈
|G| (Ψ (S )). We often use EΨ (G) for short. Obviously, by
the definitions, we have 0 ≤ DΨ (G) ≤ D(G) and |G| ≤ EΨ (G) ≤ E (G).
Remark. Note that the weighted Davenport’s constant defined here is much more general than the weighted Davenport’s
constant defined in [2]. For example, if G∗0 = G and Ψ is the identity isomorphism, then DΨ (G∗0 , G) is the traditional
Davenport’s constant. Let G be a finite abelian group and a an integer, then la : g → ag , g ∈ G is a homomorphism
from G to G. Denote M = {la , a ∈ Z}. If G∗0 = G and Ψ ⊂ M, then the weighted Davenport’s constant DΨ (G∗0 , G) is the
weighted Davenport’s constant defined in [2].

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1
Before the proof of Theorem 1.1, we need some lemmas.
Lemma 4.1. Let G be a finite abelian group, A0 ⊂ G and A1 ⊂ G subsets of G such that |A0 | ≥ 2, |A1 | ≥ 2 and A0 is not periodic.
Let B = A0 + A1 , then |B| ≥ |A0 | + 1, with equality precisely when A0 is the union of an arithmetic progression of difference d
and some ⟨d⟩-coset (the number of cosets may be 0).
Proof. It is easy to see that |B| ≥ |A0 | + 1, otherwise A0 is periodic by Kneser’s Theorem. W.l.o.g., we may assume 0 ∈ A1 .
Let d ∈ A1 and 0 ̸= d. By B ⊃ A0 ∪ (A0 + d) and |B| = |A0 | + 1, it follows that the lemma holds.
Lemma 4.2. Let Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗0 , G0 ) where G∗0 and G0 are abelian groups. Let K ∗ = {g ∗ ∈ G∗0 : |Ψ (g ∗ )| = 1} be the subgroup
of G∗0 and K = ψ(K ∗ ) for some ψ ∈ Ψ . Suppose H ≤ K , then DΨ (G∗0 , H ) = D(H ), where D(H ) is the traditional Davenport’s
constant.
Proof. Let H ∗ = K ∗ ∩ ψ −1 (H ). It is easy to see that ψ : H ∗ → H is a surjection and DΨ (H ∗ , H ) = Dψ (H ∗ , H ) = D(H ).
Since DΨ (G∗0 , H ) ≥ DΨ (H ∗ , H ) and D(H ) ≥ DΨ (G∗0 , H ) by the definitions of D(H ), DΨ (G∗0 , H ) and DΨ (G∗0 , H ), the lemma
follows.
Remark. From the proof, we can see that, for any g ∈ K , there is some g ∗ ∈ G∗0 such that Ψ (g ∗ ) = {g }.
Essentially, the proofs of the statements (7) and (8) are due to Grynkiewicz et al. (see [8]). However, while there are some
slight change, we give the detailed proofs here for completeness. We need some more lemmas to prove the statements (7)
and (8).
Lemma 4.3. Let G∗ and G be finite abelian groups, Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗ , G) and H ≤ G such that DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) ̸= {0}, then
DΨ (G) ≥ DΨ (H ) + DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1.
Proof. By the definition of DφH ·Ψ (G/H ), we can choose S1 ∈ F (G∗ ) such that H ∩

∑∪

(Ψ (S1 )) = ∅ and |S1 | = DφH ·Ψ (G/H )−1.
∑∪
∑∪

Similarly, by the definition of DΨ (H ), we can choose S2 ∈ F (G∗ ) such that 0 ̸∈
(Ψ (S2 )),
(Ψ (S2 )) ⊂ H and
∑∪
|S2 | = DΨ (H ) − 1. Therefore the sequence S = S1 S2 satisfies 0 ̸∈
(Ψ (S )) with length DΨ (H ) + DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 2,
and the lemma follows.
Lemma 4.4. Let Ψ ⊂ Hom(G∗0 , G0 ), H ≤ G ≤ G0 and α ∈ G0 with DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) ̸= {0}. Let S ∈ F (G∗0 ), Ψ (supp(S )) ⊂ α + G
and |S | ≥ DφH ·Ψ (G/H ). Moreover suppose there is some β ∗ ∈ G∗0 and β ∈ α + G such that Ψ (β ∗ ) ⊂ β + H, then there exists
some nontrivial subsequence s1 s2 · · · sr |S and ψji ∈ Ψ , such that

Proof. Consider the sequence S ′ = S − β ∗ . It is easy to see that Ψ (supp(S ′ )) ⊂ G. By the definition of DφH ·Ψ (G/H ), there
∑r
exists a nontrivial subsequence (s1 − β ∗ )(s2 − β ∗ ) · · · (sr − β ∗ ) and ψji ∈ Ψ , i = 1, . . . , r such that i=1 ψji (si − β ∗ ) = 0,
then the lemma follows from Ψ (β ∗ ) ⊂ β + H.
Lemma 4.5 ([5, Lemma 3.5]). Let G is a finite abelian group, let K ≤ G be a subgroup and A = A1 A2 · · · Ar ∈ S (G) be a
setpartition with |Ai | ≥ 2 and |φK (Ai )| = 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , r. If r ≥ |K | − 1, then there exists a nontrivial subgroup H ≤ K
and sub-setpartitions A1 |A and A2 |A1 such that

|A2 | = |H | − 1,
|σ (A2 )| = |H |,
|A1 | ≥ min{|A|, |A| − |K /H | + 2},

|φH (Aj )| = 1,

for all Aj ∈ supp(A1 ).

Now we can proceed to prove the Theorem 1.1.
Proof. The proof is by induction on |G|.
Obviously, the base case |G| = 1 is trivial. Let S = s1 · · · s|S | , Ai = Ψ (si ), i ∈ [1, |S |] and let A = A1 A2 · · · A|S | =
Ψ (s1 )Ψ (s2 ) · · · Ψ (s|S | ) denote the corresponding setpartition. W.l.o.g., we may assume that |S | = |G| + DΨ (G) − 1. Firstly,
we prove that the statements (7) and (8) hold with the assumptions that the statements (3)–(6) hold.
Let B = −β + A, and let B1′ = −β + A1 , B2 = −β + A2 , B0 = BB1′−1 and B1 = B1′ B2−1 . In order to prove (7), it is
∑∪
sufficient to prove n (B ) is H-periodic and contains 0.
∑∪
∑
Let φH (g ) ∈ {0} ∪
(φ (B )), we proceed to show that g + H ⊂ ∪n (B ).
∑∪H
Since φH (g ) ∈ {0} ∪
(φH (B )), we can find a sub-setpartition (possible empty, in which case we have φH (g ) = 0)
C0 |B0 such that φH (g ) ∈ σ (φH (C0 )). Let C0 be maximal in length with |C0 | ≤ n −|H |, then |C0 | ≥ min{|B0 |− DφH ·Ψ (G/H )+
1, n − |H | − DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) + 1} by the definition of DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) and Lemma 4.4.
Since n − |C0 | − |H | ≥ 0,
n − |C0 | − |H | ≤ n − min{n − |H |, |B0 |} + DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1 − |H |

= max{0, n − |B0 | − |H |} + DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1,
and
DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1 ≤ DΨ (G) − DΨ (H ) ≤ |S1 | − |S2 | = |B1 |,
we have
n − |B0 | − |H | + DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1 ≤ |S | − DΨ (G) + 1 − |B0 | − |H | + DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1

= |B1 | − DΨ (G) + DΨ (H ) + DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1
≤ |B1 |
by Lemma 4.3. So we can choose a sub-setpartition C1 |B1 with length n − |C0 | − |H |.
∑∪
Now σ (C0 C1 ) ∩ (g + H ) ̸= ∅, let g0 ∈ σ (C0 C1 ) ∩ g + H. By (6), H ⊂
|H | (B2 ), it follows that g + H = g0 + H ⊂
n (B ), which completes the proof of (7).
Now we will prove (8). Let B = B0 B1 B2 be as above.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that S1 is maximal such that (3)–(6) hold. Suppose
∏that (8) fails, then we have
that H ≤ G is a proper subgroup and |B0 | ≥ |G/H | − 1. Let the index set of B0 be I0 and D ′ = i∈I0 ({0} ∪ Bi ) ∈ S (G), then
every set in D ′ contains at least two cosets of H by the assumption on S1 .
Applying Lemma 4.5 to φH (D ) with K = G/H, and let L/H < G/H be the resulting nontrivial subgroup and D1′ |D ′ and
D2′ |D1′ the resulting sub-setpartitions. W.l.o.g. (by a translation if necessary), we may assume that σ (φH (D2′ )) = L/H. Let
D1 |B0 and D2 |D1 be the corresponding sub-setpartitions of D1′ and D2′ , respectively. We claim that L is a subgroup of G
which satisfies the conclusions of Theorem 1.1, which contradicts the maximality of H. Therefore it remains to prove the
claim.

∑∪

( C0 C1 B 2 ) ⊂

∑∪

Proof of the claim. It is easy to see that |D1 B1 B2 | ≥ min{|S |, |S | − |G/L| + 2} ≥ |L| + DΨ (G) − 1 and D1 B1 B2 ∈ S (L), so
(3) and (4) hold for L.
Since DφH ·Ψ (L/H ) − 1 ≤ DφH ·Ψ (G/H ) − 1 ≤ DΨ (G) − DΨ (H ) = |B1 |, we can choose a sub-setpartition C1 |B1 of length
DφH ·Ψ (L/H ) − 1. Since

|D2 | + |C1 | + |B2 | = |L/H | − 1 + DΨ (L/H ) − 1 + H + DΨ (H ) − 1
≤ |L| + DΨ (L) − 1,
we can choose a sub-setpartition C0 |D1 D2−1 B1 C1−1 of length |L| + DΨ (L) − 1 − |D2 | − |C1 | − |B2 |.
∑∪
∑∪
Now we show that L =
|L| (C0 D2 C1 B2 ). Obviously, L ⊃
|L| (C0 D2 C1 B2 ) holds, we only need to show the reverse
inclusion relation. For any g ∈ L, choose C0⋆ |C0 of length |L| − |L/H | − |H | + 1 (which is possible since |C0 | ≥ |L| − |L/H | −
|H | + 1) and let g0 ∈ g − σ (C0⋆ ) (g0 = g if C0⋆ is empty). Choose D2⋆ |D2 of maximal length such that g0 + H ∩ σ (D2⋆ ) ̸= ∅,

X. Zeng, P. Yuan / Discrete Mathematics 311 (2011) 1940–1947

1945

then |D2⋆ | ≥ |D2 | − DΨ (L/H ) + 1 by Lemma 4.4. Choose C1⋆ |C1 of length |D2 | − |D2⋆ | and let g1 ∈ (g0 − σ (D2⋆ C1⋆ )) ∩ H.
Finally, by (6), we can choose B2⋆ |B2 of length |H | such that g1 ∈ σ (B2⋆ ). It is easy to see that g ∈ σ (C0⋆ D2⋆ C1⋆ B2⋆ ), and
∑∪
hence L ⊂
|L| (C0 D2 C1 B2 ), which implies that (5) and (6) hold for L, which completes the proof of the claim and the
statement (8).
To prove the statements (3)–(6), we first prove some claims.
Claim 4.1. Suppose that there exist the element α0 ∈ α + G, the proper subgroup K ≤ G, subsequence T |S such that
|T | ≥ |K | + DΨ (G) − 1 and Ψ (T ) ∈ S (α0 + K ), then the theorem holds for S.
Proof. We can apply the induction hypothesis to the subsequence T . we get the resulting maximal subgroup H ≤ K , element
β ∈ α0 + K and subsequence T1 |T and T2 |T1 . Now it is easy to see that |T1 | ≥ min{|T |, |T | − |K /H | + 2} ≥ |H | + DΨ (G) − 1,
then the theorem holds with the result.
Claim 4.2. Let T = t1 t2 · · · t|T | ∈ F (G∗0 ) be a sequence over G∗0 such that |T | = |S | and Ψ (ti ) ⊂ Ψ (si ) for any i ∈ [1, |S |].
Suppose that the statements (3)–(6) hold for T , then the statements (3)–(6) hold for S.
Proof. Since the statements (3)–(6) hold for T , we can get the resulting maximal subgroup K ≤ G, element γ ∈ α + G and
subsequences T1 |T and T2 |T1 . Choose i ∈ [1, |S |] with si ̸= ti and replace ti by si , then we obtain a new sequence U = Tti−1 si .
We now prove the statements (3)–(6) hold for U, then applying the replacement iteratively implies that the statements
(3)–(6) hold for S.
If ti ∈ TT1−1 , then it is obviously that the statements (3)–(6) hold for U with the subgroup K ≤ G, element γ ∈ α + G and
subsequences T1 |U∑
and T2 |T1 .

If K = G, then |G| (Ψ (U )) ⊃
|G| (Ψ (T )), which implies that the statements (3)–(6) hold for U with the subgroup G,
element α and subsequences U1 = U2 = U.
If K < G is proper and ti ∈ T1 , let U0 = T1 ti−1 . It is easy to see that |U0 | = |T1 | − 1 ≥ |U | − |G/K | + 1 ≥ |K | + DΨ (G) − 1
and the statements (3)–(6) hold for U by Claim 4.1, completing the proof.
Claim 4.3. If there exist an element g0 ∈ α + G, nontrivial subgroup K0 ≤ G and sub-setpartition A0 |A such that |A0 | ≤ |G|/2
and g0 + K0 ⊂ σ (A0 ), then the statements (3)–(6) hold.
Proof. If K0 = G, then it is obvious that the statements (3)–(6) hold with the subgroup G, element α , subsequences
S1 = S2 = S. So we may assume that K0 < G is proper. Let C = A(A0 )−1 . Notice that we can apply induction hypothesis
to φK0 (C ). Now we obtain the resulting subgroups K /K0 ≤ G/K0 , elements φK0 (γ ) ∈ φK0 (α) + G/K0 and sub-setpartitions
C1 |C and C2 |C1 .
If K = G. In order to understand easily, we let A⋆ = A − γ , A⋆0 = A0 − γ , C ⋆ = C − γ , C1⋆ = C1 − γ and C2⋆ = C2 − γ ,
∑∪
now the operations are among the subgroups instead of cosets. It is sufficient to prove that |G| (A⋆ ) = G.
Let g0⋆ + K0 ⊂ σ (A⋆0 ) and notice that C ⋆ = C1⋆ . Now we proceed to prove g ∈

for any g ∈ G.

Obviously, we can choose a sub-setpartition D1 |C (C2 ) of length |G| − |A0 | − |G/K0 | and let g1 ∈ (g − σ (D1⋆ )). By the
definition of C2⋆ , we can choose a sub-setpartition D2⋆ |C2⋆ of length |G/K0 |, which satisfies that (g1 − g0⋆ + K0 ) ∩ σ (D2⋆ ) ̸= ∅.
∑∪

Let g2 ∈ (g1 −σ (D2⋆ ))∩(g0⋆ + K0 ), then by the definition of A⋆0 , we have g2 ∈ σ (A⋆0 ). Therefore we have proven g ∈

and G ⊂
|G| (A ). Note that the reverse inclusion is trivial, which completes the proof.
If K < G is proper, then |C1 | ≥ |C | − |G/K | + 2 ≥ |G|/2 + DΨ (G) − 1 − |G/K | + 2 ≥ |K | + DΨ (G) − 1 and the statements
(3)–(6) hold for S by Claim 4.1. Then we have completed the proof.

If L = G, then the theorem holds with subgroup H = G, element β = α and subsequences S2 = S1 = S. Therefore we
may assume L < G is proper.
If L is nontrivial, then applying the induction hypothesis to φL (A) (using n = |G| in (7)), we get the maximal subgroup
K /L, elements φL (γ ) ∈ φL (α) + G/L and subsequences T1 |S and T2 |T1 . If K /L is nontrivial, then it contradicts L being the
∑∪
maximal period for n (A). Therefore, we may assume K = L. Let C1 denote the corresponding sub-setpartition of T1 . Since
C1 ∈ S (γ + L) and |T1 | ≥ |S | − |G/L| + 2 ≥ |L| + DΨ (G) − 1, the theorem holds for S by Claim 4.1, which completes the
proof of this case.
If L = {∏
0} is trivial. Let I1 =
∏{i ∈ [1, |S |] : |Ai | = 1} and I2 = {i ∈ [1, |S |] : |Ai | ≥ 2}. Let N≥2 (A) = |I2 | and N1 (A) = |I1 |.
Let B1 = i∈I1 Ai and B2 = i∈I2 Ai . We give some remarks. N≥2 (A) ≤ |G| − 2 (otherwise it would contradict the fact that
L = {0}); If |Ai | = 1 for some i ∈ [1, |S |], then the multiplicity of Ai in A is less than DΨ (G) (otherwise the theorem would
hold with subgroup H = {0}). Now we have the decomposition A = B1 B2 .

Case 1: N1 (A) = |S |, then we may assume that |Ψ | = 1 and consider A as a sequence. W.l.o.g., let Ψ = {ψ}.
∑∪
∑∪
It is easy to see that
|G| (A) = σ (A) −
DΨ (G)−1 (A). However, the multiplicity Ai in A is less than DΨ (G), then the

Devos–Goddyn–Mohar Theorem implies DΨ (G)−1 (A) is periodic and so is |G| (A), a contradiction.
Case 2: G is a cyclic group.
If there is some g ∈ α + G such that |Ig | ≥ |G| where Ig = {i ∈ [1, |S |] : g ∈ Ai }, since N≥2 (A) ≤ |G| − 2, it follows that
there is some k ∈ Ig such that Ak = {g }. Replacing si by sk for all i ∈ Ig , we obtain a new sequence T . It is easy to see that the
theorem holds for T . By Claim 4.2, the theorem holds for S. Therefore we may assume such g does not exist.
If N≥2 (A) ≥ |G| − DΨ (G), then the Devos–Goddyn–Mohar Theorem implies that L is nontrivial, a contradiction. Thus we
may assume that N≥2 (A) < |G| − DΨ (G).
Let K ≤ G be the minimal subgroup such that B1 ∈ S (α0 + K ) for some α0 ∈ α + G, we have DΨ (G) ≥ DΨ (G∗0 , K ) = D(K )
by Lemma 4.2. Since G is a cyclic group, then DΨ (G) ≥ D(K ) = |K |, and so A1 = |S | − A2 > 2DΨ (G) − 1 ≥ |K | + DΨ (G) − 1,
which completes the proof of the case by Claim 4.1.
Case 3: G is not cyclic and N1 (A) < |S |. Let K ≤ G be the minimal subgroup such that B1 ∈ S (α0 + K ) for some α0 ∈ α+ G.
Since the multiplicity of Ai with |Ai | = 1 in A is less than DΨ (G) and N1 (A) ≥ DΨ (G)+1, we have that |K | ≥ 2 is nontrivial.
If N1 (A) ≥ |K |+ DΨ (G)− 1, then Claim 4.1 implies that the theorem holds. So we may assume that N1 (A) < |K |+ DΨ (G)− 1.
Subcase 3.1: If K = G, then D(K ) = DΨ (G) by Lemma 4.2. By the Remark of Lemma 4.2, we have that for any g ∈ α + G,
there exists some g ∗ ∈ G∗0 such that Ψ (g ∗ ) = {g }. It follows that we can replace si ∈ supp(S ) by ti for any i ∈ [1, |S |],
which satisfies Ψ (ti ) ⊂ Ψ (si ) and |Ψ (ti )| = 1. Now we obtain a new sequence T and we can apply Case 1 to this case, so
the theorem holds for T , which implies that the theorem holds for S by Claim 4.2.
Subcase 3.2: If K < G is proper. W.l.o.g., we may assume that the index set of B2 is [1, |B2 |]. Recall that |B2 | = N≥2 (A) ≥
|G| − |K | + 1 ≥ |G|/2 + 1. Now we construct a sub-setpartition sequence Di |B2 recursively. Let the last sub-setpartition
be Dk when the construction ends in the kth step.
First, let D1 = A1 . Suppose that we have constructed Di , we let Di = σ (Di ) and Ci = B2 (Di )−1 .
If Di is periodic, end the construction and label this ending sub-setpartition Di by ‘‘Periodic end’’. If there is some term
Ci+1 |Ci such that |Di + Ci+1 | ≥ |Di | + 2, then let Di+1 = Di Ci+1 and Ci+1 = Ci (Ci+1 )−1 . If such Ci+1 does not exist, end the
construction and label this ending sub-setpartition Di by ‘‘Cyclic end’’.
Now we claim that the construction must end with ‘‘Periodic end’’ or ‘‘Cyclic end’’. By the construction of Di , we have
|Di | ≥ 2i. By Kneser’s Theorem, the three cases in the last paragraph contain all the possibilities. By |A2 | ≥ |G|/2 + 1, the
second case must end in the finite steps and then will end with ‘‘Periodic end’’ or ‘‘Cyclic end’’. Therefore the claim holds.
Recall that Dk is the resulting sub-setpartition of the construction and Dk = σ (Dk ) when the construction ends in the
kth step. It follows that |Dk | ≤ |G|/2 by |Di | ≥ 2i. Let Ck = B2 (Dk )−1 , then |Ck | = |B2 | − |Dk | ≥ 1.
Subcase 3.2.1: If the ending is ‘‘Periodic end’’, let H = Stab(Dk ) be the period of Dk . Applying Claim 4.3 with the subsetpartition Dk and the subgroup H < G, we complete the proof.
Subcase 3.2.2: If the ending is ‘‘Cyclic end’’, by Lemma 4.1, the construction of Dk and |Ck | ≥ 1, Dk is the union of an
arithmetic progression of difference d and some ⟨d⟩-cosets. Let H = ⟨d⟩.
If the periodic part of Dk is not empty, then applying Claim 4.3 with sub-setpartition Dk and subgroup H, it follows that
the theorem holds in this case.
If the periodic part of Dk is empty, then Dk is a subset of some H-coset. Therefore for any Ai |Dk , we have |φH (Ai )| = 1,
otherwise it would contradict Bk being a subset of some H-coset. For any term Aj |Ck , if |φH (Aj )| > 1, then |Dk + Aj | ≥ 2|Dk | ≥
|Dk | + 2, which contradicts the construction of Dk . Therefore for any term Ai |B2 , we have |φH (Ai )| = 1. Since G is not cyclic,
|B2 | ≥ |G|/2 + 1 ≥ |H |. Applying Lemma 4.5 to B2 , we get the subgroup H ′ ≤ H and sub-setpartition B2′ |B2 such that
|B2′ | = |H ′ | − 1 ≤ |G|/2 and σ (B2′ ) = g0 + H ′ for some g0 ∈ G0 . Now we can apply Claim 4.3 with the subgroup H ′ ≤ H
and sub-setpartition B2′ |B2 .
This completes the proof.

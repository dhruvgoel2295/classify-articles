abstract
An edge of a 5-connected graph is said to be 5-contractible if the contraction of the
edge results in a 5-connected graph. A 5-connected graph with no 5-contractible edge
is said to be contraction-critically 5-connected. Let V (G) and V5 (G) denote the vertex
set of a graph G and the set of degree 5 vertices of G, respectively. We prove that each
contraction-critically 5-connected graph G has at least |V (G)|/2 vertices of degree 5. We
also show that there is a sequence of contraction-critically 5-connected graphs {Gi } such
that limi→∞ |V5 (Gi )|/|V (Gi )| = 1/2.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we deal with finite undirected graphs with neither loops nor multiple edges. For a graph G, let V (G) and
E (G) denote the set of vertices of G and the set of edges of G, respectively. Let Vk (G) denote the set of vertices of degree
k and let V≥k (G) denote the set of vertices of degree greater than or equal to k. For an edge e ∈ E (G), we denote the
set of end vertices of e by V (e). Let EG (x) = {e ∈ E (G) | x ∈ V (e)}. For a vertex x ∈ V (G), we denote by NG (x) the
neighborhood of x in G. Moreover, for a subset S ⊂ V (G), let NG (S ) = ∪x∈S N (x) − S. We denote the degree of x ∈ V (G)
by degG (x). Then degG (x) = |EG (x)| = |NG (x)|. When there is no ambiguity, we write Vk , V≥k , E (x), N (x), N (S ) and deg(x)
for Vk (G), V≥k (G), EG (x), NG (x), NG (S ) and degG (x), respectively. For S ⊂ V (G), let G[S ] denote the subgraph induced by S in
G. Let G be a connected graph. A subset S ⊂ V (G) is said to be a cutset of G, if G − S is not connected. A cutset S is said to
be a k-cutset if |S | = k. For a noncomplete connected graph G, the order of a minimum cutset of G is said to be the vertex
connectivity of G. We denote the vertex connectivity of G by κ(G).
Let k be an integer such that k ≥ 2 and let G be a k-connected graph. An edge e of G is said to be k-contractible if the
contraction of the edge results in a k-connected graph. Note that, in the contraction, we replace each resulting pair of double
edges by a simple edge. If an edge is not k-contractible, then it is called a noncontractible edge. Note that an edge e of G is
not k-contractible if and only if there is a k-cutset S of G such that V (e) ⊂ S. If a k-connected graph G has no k-contractible
edge, then G is said to be contraction-critically k-connected.
It is known that every 3-connected graph of order 5 or more contains a 3-contractible edge [9]. There are infinitely many
contraction-critically 4-connected graphs. It is known that a 4-connected graph G is contraction-critical if and only if G
is 4-regular, and for each edge e of it, there is a triangle which contains e. [3,6]. If k ≥ 4, then there are infinitely many
contraction-critically k-connected graphs [8].
Egawa determined the following sharp minimum degree condition for a k-connected graph to have a k-contractible edge.

There is a contraction-critically 5-connected graph which is not 5-regular. However, we see from Theorem A that the
minimum degree of a contraction-critically 5-connected graph is 5. Ando et al. [1] posed Problem D and proved Theorem C,
which says that each contraction-critically 5-connected graph has many vertices of degree 5.
Theorem C. Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph of order n. Then each vertex of G has a neighbor of degree 5 and
G has at least n/5 vertices of degree 5.
Problem D. Determine the maximum value of the constant c such that the inequality |V5 (G)| ≥ c |V (G)| holds for each
contraction-critically 5-connected graph G.
The following important result was showed by Su [7].
Theorem E. Every vertex of a contraction-critically 5-connected graph has two neighbors of degree five.
As an immediate consequence of Theorem E, we have the following.
Theorem F. For every contraction-critically 5-connected graph G, |V5 | ≥

|V (G)| holds.

By more detailed investigation of contraction-critically 5-connected graphs, Yuan and others [10] proved the following
Theorems H and G.
Theorem G. Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph and let x be a vertex of G with degG (x) ≥ 8. If x has adjacent
two neighbors of degree five, then x has three neighbors of degree five.
Theorem H. For every contraction-critically 5-connected graph G, |V5 (G)| ≥

|V (G)| holds.

On the other hands, there is a contraction-critically 5-connected graph G such that |V5 (G)| =
Ando posed the following conjecture.
Conjecture I. The constant c for Problem D is

In this paper we prove the following stronger version of Theorem G (Proposition 1). And using Proposition 1, by detailed
investigation on vertices not in V5 (G) each of which has just two neighbors of degree 5, we show the constant c in Problem D
is not less than 12 (Main Theorem). Moreover, we construct a sequence of contraction-critically 5-connected graphs {Gi } such
that limi→∞ |V5 (Gi )|/|V (Gi )| = 1/2.
This sequence disproves Conjecture I and, together with Main Theorem, it gives the answer for Problem D, that is c = 12 .
Proposition 1. Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph and let x be a vertex of G such that x ̸∈ V5 (G). Suppose
|NG (x) ∩ V5 (G)| = 2, say NG (x) ∩ V5 (G) = {y1 , y2 }. Then y1 y2 ̸∈ E (G).
Next we concentrate on vertices not in V5 (G) each of which has just two neighbors of degree 5 and we find two specific
configurations.
Configuration of the first kind. A subgraph H on eight vertices (in degenerated case, on seven vertices) of a contractioncritically 5-connected graph G is called a configuration of the first kind around (x, y) if the following (1)–(4) hold (see Fig. 1).

(4)

V (H ) = {x, y, z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , u1 , u2 },
E (H ) ⊃ {yx, yz1 , yz2 , yz3 , yz4 , xz4 , z1 z2 , z1 z3 , z1 u1 , z1 u2 , z2 u1 , z3 u2 },
{y, z1 , z2 , z3 } ⊂ V5 and {x, z4 } ∩ V5 = ∅,
There is a 5-cutset S such that {x, y, z1 } ⊂ S and S separates {u1 , z2 } and {u2 , z3 , z4 }.

In a configuration of the first kind, if z4 = u2 , then it is said to be a degenerated configuration of the first kind.
Configuration of the second kind. A subgraph H on nine vertices of a contraction-critically 5-connected graph G is called a
configuration of the second kind around (y, x) if the following (1)–(4) hold (see Fig. 2).

(4)

V (H ) = {x, y, z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , u1 , w1 , w2 },
E (H ) ⊃ {yx, yz1 , yz2 , yz3 , yz4 , xz3 , xz4 , z1 z2 , z1 z3 , z1 z4 , z1 u1 , z2 u1 , z3 z4 , z3 w1 , z3 w2 , z4 w1 , z4 w2 },
{y, z1 , z2 , w1 , w2 } ⊂ V5 , x ̸∈ V5 .
{x, y, z1 , w1 , w2 } is a 5-cutset of G which separates {z2 , u} and {z3 , z4 }, and hence {z3 , z4 } ⊂ V6 (G).

Proposition 2. Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph. Let x be a vertex of G such that x ̸∈ V5 and |N (x)∩V5 (G)| = 2.
Let y ∈ N (x) ∩ V5 (G). Then, around (y, x), there is either a configuration of the first kind or a configuration of the second kind.
By virtue of Proposition 2, we get the following result.
Main Theorem. For every contraction-critically 5-connected graph G, |V5 (G)| ≥

|V (G)| holds.

Recently, Li and Su [5] proved the same bound of the constant c in Problem D.
The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains preliminary results. In Section 3 we give a proof of
Proposition 1. In Section 4 we give a proof of Proposition 2 and in Section 5 we give a proof of Main Theorem.
To conclude this section we give three contraction-critically 5-connected graphs. The first one has a configuration of the
first kind. The second has a configuration of the second kind. The third shows that there is a sequence of contraction-critically
5-connected graphs {Gi } such that limi→∞ |V5 (Gi )|/|V (Gi )| = 1/2.
Example 1. The graph G1 illustrated in Fig. 3 is contraction-critically 5-connected, and we observe that it has a configuration
of the first kind.
Example 2. The graph G2 illustrated in Fig. 4 is contraction-critically 5-connected. We observe that G2 has a configuration
of the second kind.
Example 3. The graph G3 illustrated in Fig. 5 is contraction-critically 5-connected. Adding pairs of vertices (x4 , y4 ), (x5 , y5 ),
. . . , (xi , yi ) to this graph by the similar way, we can construct a sequence of contraction-critically 5-connected graphs {Gi }.
We see that |V (Gi )| = 2i + 15 and |V5 (Gi )| = i + 10 since {y1 , y2 , . . . , yi } ⊂ V5 (Gi ) and {x1 , x2 , . . . , xi } ⊂ V6 (Gi ). Hence we
have limi→∞ |V5 (Gi )|/|V (Gi )| = 1/2.

2. Preliminaries
In this section we give some more definitions and preliminary results.
For a graph G, we denote |G| for |V (G)|. For a subgraphs A and B of a graph G, when there is no ambiguity, we write simply
A for V (A) and B for V (B). So N (A) and A ∩ B mean N (V (A)) and V (A) ∩ V (B), respectively. Also for a subgraph A of G and a
subset S of V (G) we write A ∩ S and A ∪ S for V (A) ∩ S and V (A) ∪ S, respectively. For S ⊂ V (G), we let G − S denote the

K. Ando, T. Iwase / Discrete Mathematics 311 (2011) 1925–1939

1929

graph obtained from G by deleting the vertices in S together with the edges incident with them; thus G − S = G[V (G) − S ].
When there is no ambiguity, we write E (S ) for E (G[S ]). For subsets S and T of V (G), we denote the set of edges between S
and T by EG (S , T ). We write EG (x, S ) for EG ({x}, S ). Then EG (x) = EG (x, V (G) − {x}).
An induced subgraph A of a k-connected graph G is called a fragment if |N (A)| = k and V (G) − (A ∪ N (A)) ̸= ∅. In other
words, a fragment A is a nonempty union of components of G − S where S is a k-cutset of G such that V (G) − (A ∪ S ) ̸= ∅.
By the definition, if A is a fragment of G, then G − (A ∪ N (A)) is also a fragment of G. Let A¯ stand for G − (A ∪ N (A)).
Let A be a fragment of a k-connected graph G and let e be an edge of G. Then A is said to be a fragment with respect to e if
V (e) ⊂ N (A). For a set of edges F ⊂ E (G), we say that A is a fragment with respect to F if A is a fragment with respect to some
e ∈ F . Sometimes we write ‘‘an F -fragment’’ for ‘‘a fragment with respect to F ’’. If F = {e}, then we write e-fragment instead
¯ respectively. Hence, if A
of {e}-fragment. For S ⊂ V (G), a fragment A is said to be S-free and S-opposite if A ∩ S = ∅ and S ⊂ A,
is S-opposite, the A is S-free. If S = {y}, then we write y-free and y-opposite instead of {y}-free and {y}-opposite, respectively.
An F -fragment A is said to be minimum (resp. minimal) if there is no F -fragment B other than A such that |B| < |A| (resp.
B A).
Hereafter, we consider 5-connected graphs. Let A be a fragment of a 5-connected graph G and let S = N (A). Let x ∈ S and
let y ∈ N (x) ∩ A. A vertex z is said to be an admissible vertex of (x, y; A), if the following two conditions hold.
(1) z ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ S ∩ V5 .
(2) |N (z ) ∩ A| ≥ 2.
Moreover, if |N (z ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, then z is said to be strongly admissible.
A vertex z is said to be an admissible vertex of (x; A) or a strongly admissible vertex of (x; A), if z is an admissible vertex
of (x, y; A) or a strongly admissible vertex of (x, y; A) for some y ∈ N (x) ∩ A. Let Ad(x, y; A) denote the set of admissible
vertices of (x, y; A) and let Ad(x; A) denote the set of admissible vertices of (x; A). Let A be a fragment of a 5-connected graph
G and let x ∈ N (A). A fragment B of G is said to be (x; A)-fit if {x} ∪ A ⊂ N (B). A vertex x ∈ N (A) is said to be tractable with A
if there is an (x; A)-fit fragment B such that |S ∩ B| = |S ∩ B¯ | = 2. If there is no ambiguity, we sometimes write ‘‘A-tractable’’
for ‘‘tractable with A’’.
We begin with the following two lemmas, which are both simple observations.
Lemma 1. Let A be a fragment of a 5-connected graph G and let S ⊂ N (A). If |N (S ) ∩ A| < |S |, then A ⊂ N (S ).
Proof. Assume that A ̸= N (S ) ∩ A. Let A′ = A − (N (S ) ∩ A). Since A′ ̸= ∅ and N (A′ ) ∩ (A¯ ∪ S ) = ∅, (N (A) − S ) ∪ (N (S ) ∩ A)
separates A′ and A¯ ∪ S. Since |N (S ) ∩ A| < |S |, we see that |(N (A) − S ) ∪ (N (S ) ∩ A)| = |N (A)| − |S | + |N (S ) ∩ A| < |N (A)| = 5,
which contradicts the assumption that G is 5-connected.
Lemma 2. Let G be a 5-connected graph, and let A and B be fragments of G Let S = N (A) and T = N (B).

Then the following hold.

(1) If |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≥ 6, then |(A¯ ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ B¯ )| ≤ 4 and A¯ ∩ B¯ = ∅. In particular, if neither A ∩ B
nor A¯ ∩ B¯ is empty, then both A ∩ B and A¯ ∩ B¯ are fragments of G.
(2) |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| = 5 + |S ∩ B| − |A¯ ∩ T |. In particular, if A ∩ B ̸= ∅, then |S ∩ B| ≥ |A¯ ∩ T |.
(3) If |A¯ | ≥ 2, then either |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 5 or |(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 5.
Proof. (1) Since S and T are both 5-cutsets, |S | + |T | = |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ B¯ )| + |(A¯ ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| = 10.
Hence, if |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≥ 6, then |(A¯ ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ B¯ )| ≤ 4, which implies that A¯ ∩ B¯ = ∅, since G
is 5-connected. If neither A ∩ B nor A¯ ∩ B¯ is empty, then |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )|, |(A¯ ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ B¯ )| ≥ 5,
which implies |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| = |(A¯ ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ B¯ )| = 5. Hence, we see that both A ∩ B and A¯ ∩ B¯
are fragments of G.
(2) Since |T | = |(A¯ ∩T )∪(S ∩T )∪(A∩T )| = 5, we see that |(S ∩B)∪(S ∩T )∪(A∩T )| = |T |+|S ∩B|−|A¯ ∩T | = 5+|S ∩B|−|A¯ ∩T |.
Next assume A ∩ B ̸= ∅. Then (S ∩ B)∪(S ∩ T )∪(A ∩ T ) is a cutset of G since A¯ ∪ B¯ ̸= ∅. Hence |(S ∩ B)∪(S ∩ T )∪(A ∩ T )| ≥ 5.
Thus, we have |S ∩ B| ≥ |A¯ ∩ T |.
(3) Assume |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≥ 6 and |(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≥ 6. Then, by (1), we have A¯ ∩ B = A¯ ∩ B¯ = ∅,
which implies |A¯ ∩ T | = |A¯ | ≥ 2. Hence we see that |(S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| = |T | − |A¯ ∩ T | ≤ 3. On the other hand, since
|S | = 5, we observe that either |S ∩ B| ≤ 2 or |S ∩ B¯ | ≤ 2. This together with the fact |(S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 3 implies
either |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 5 or |(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 5, which contradicts the assumption.
Lemma 3. Let x be a vertex of a contraction-critically 5-connected graph G. Let A be a fragment with respect to E (x) such that
|A¯ | ≥ 2 and |A| ≥ 3. For each y ∈ N (x) ∩ A, if Ad(x, y; A) = ∅, then there is a fragment A′ with respect to xy such that A′ A.

Proof. Assume that there is neither an admissible vertex of (x, y; A) nor an xy-fragment A′ such that A′
A. Let B be an xyfragment. Let S = N (A) and let T = N (B). Since |A¯ | ≥ 2, by Lemma 2(3), we see that either |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 5
or |(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 5. Without loss of generality we may assume |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≤ 5. Then,
since there is no xy-fragment A′ such that A′
A, we see that A ∩ B = ∅.
Claim 3.1. A ∩ B¯ ̸= ∅.
Proof. Assume A ∩ B¯ = ∅. Then, since A ∩ B = ∅, we have A = A ∩ T and |A| = |A ∩ T | ≥ 3, which implies that
|A¯ ∩ T | = |T | − |S ∩ T | − |A ∩ T | ≤ 1. Hence, since |A¯ | ≥ 2, by symmetry, we may assume that A¯ ∩ B¯ ̸= ∅. Then,
by Lemma 2(2), we observe that |S ∩ B¯ | ≥ |A ∩ T | ≥ 3, which implies that |S ∩ B| = |S | − |S ∩ T | − |S ∩ B¯ | ≤ 1. If
S ∩ B = ∅, then we have B = ∅, which contradicts the choice of B. Hence |S ∩ B| = 1, say S ∩ B = {z }. Then we observe
that z ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ S ∩ V5 and |N (z ) ∩ A| = |A ∩ T | = 3. Now we see that z ∈ Ad(x, y; A), which contradicts the
assumption.
By Claim 3.1, we see that A ∩ B¯ ̸= ∅. If |(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| = 5, then A ∩ B¯ is an xy-fragment such that A ∩ B¯
A,
which contradicts the assumption. Hence we have |(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≥ 6. Thus, by Lemma 2(1), we observe that
A¯ ∩ B = ∅, which implies B = S ∩ B since A ∩ B = ∅. We show that |B| = |S ∩ B| = 1. Assume that |S ∩ B| ≥ 2. Since
|(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| ≥ 6, applying Lemma 2(2) with the roles S ∩ B and A¯ ∩ T replaced by A ∩ T and S ∩ B, respectively,
we see that |A ∩ T | ≥ |S ∩ B| + 1 ≥ 3, which implies that |A¯ ∩ T | = |T | − |S ∩ T | − |A ∩ T | ≤ 1 since x ∈ S ∩ T . Hence,
since |A¯ ∩ T | < |S ∩ B|, applying Lemma 2(2), we see that A¯ ∩ B¯ = ∅, which implies |A¯ | = |A¯ ∩ T | ≤ 1. This contradicts
the assumption and it is shown that |S ∩ B| = 1, say B = S ∩ B = {z }. Then we observe that z ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ S ∩ V5 and
|N (z ) ∩ A| = |A ∩ T | ≥ |S ∩ B| + 1 = 2. Hence z is an admissible vertex of (x, y; A), which contradicts the assumption. This
contradiction proves Lemma 3.
The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Lemma 3.
Corollary 4. Let x be a vertex of a contraction-critically 5-connected graph G. Let A be a fragment with respect to E (x) such that
|A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3. Suppose |N (x) ∩ A| = 1, say N (x) ∩ A = {y}. Then there is an admissible vertex of (x, y; A).
Proof. Assume that there is no admissible vertex of (x, y; A). Then, Lemma 3 assure us that there is an xy-fragment A′ such
that A′
A. Since N (x) ∩ A = {y}, we observe that N (x) ∩ A′ = ∅, which contradicts the fact that A′ is an xy-fragment. This
contradiction proves Corollary 4.
Let A be a fragment of a 5-connected graph and let x ∈ N (A). Recall that a fragment B is (x; A)-fit if A ∪ {x} ⊂ N (B) and a
vertex x ∈ N (A) is tractable with A if there is an (x; A)-fit fragment B such that |S ∩ B| = |S ∩ B¯ | = 2.
Lemma 5. Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph. Let A be a fragment such that |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| = 2 and A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅.
Then the following (1), (2) and (3) hold.
(1) |{x ∈ N (A) | Ad(x; A) ̸= ∅}| ≥ 4.
(2) If Ad(x; A) = ∅ for x ∈ N (A), then N (x) ∩ N (A) = ∅.
(3) |N (A) ∩ V5 | ≥ 4.
Proof. Let S = N (A) and let A = {y1 , y2 }. We may assume that degG (y1 ) ≤ degG (y2 ), then we observe that degG (y2 ) = 6
and S ⊂ N (y2 ) since A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅.
Claim 5.1. For each x ∈ S, there is an (x; A)-fit fragment.
Proof. At first we consider the case that xy1 ∈ E (G). Let B be an xy1 -fragment. Then, since S ⊂ N (y2 ), we observe that
y2 ∈ N (B), which implies that B is an (x; A)-fit fragment. Next assume that xy1 ̸∈ E (G). Then we observe that S −{x} ⊂ N (y1 ).
Let B be an xy2 -fragment. Then, since S − {x} ⊂ N (y1 ), we see that y1 ∈ N (B), which implies that B is an (x; A)-fit fragment.
Now Claim 5.1 is proved.
Claim 5.2. If x ∈ S is not tractable with A, then Ad(x; A) ̸= ∅.
Proof. Assume x is not tractable with A. By Claim 5.1, let B an (x; A)-fit fragment and let T = N (B). Since x is not tractable
with A, we know that either |S ∩ B| = 1 or |S ∩ B¯ | = 1. Without loss of generality, we may assume that |S ∩ B| = 1, say
S ∩ B = {z }. Then, since |S ∩ B| < |A ∩ T |, by Lemma 2(2), we see that A¯ ∩ B = ∅, which implies that B = S ∩ B = {z }.
Hence, we observe that z ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ S ∩ V5 and |N (z ) ∩ A| = |A| = 2, which implies that z ∈ Ad(x; A) and Claim 5.2
is proved.
Let S = {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 }.
Claim 5.3. If both x1 and x2 are tractable with A, then neither Ad(x1 ; A) nor Ad(x2 ; A) is empty.
Proof. Since both x1 and x2 are tractable with A, there are an (x1 ; A)-fit fragment B1 and an (x2 ; A)-fit fragment B2 such that
|S ∩ B1 | = |S ∩ B¯ 1 | = |S ∩ B2 | = |S ∩ B¯ 2 | = 2. Let T1 = N (B1 ) and T2 = N (B2 ). Then, we observe that A ⊂ T1 ∩ T2 , S ∩ T1 = {x1 }
and S ∩ T2 = {x2 }. Without loss of generality, we may assume that S ∩ B1 = {x2 , x3 } and S ∩ B¯ 1 = {x4 , x5 }. Furthermore,
without loss of generality, we may assume that x1 ∈ S ∩ B2 .

At first we consider the case that x3 ∈ S ∩ B2 . In this case S ∩ B2 = {x1 , x3 } and S ∩ B¯ 2 = {x4 , x5 }. Then we observe that
x3 ∈ B1 ∩ B2 and {x4 , x5 } ⊂ B¯ 1 ∩ B¯ 2 , which implies that neither B1 ∩ B2 nor B¯ 1 ∩ B¯ 2 is empty. Then, Lemma 2(1) assures us
that both B1 ∩ B2 and B¯ 1 ∩ B¯ 2 are fragments of G. Moreover, we observe that {y1 , y2 } ⊂ T1 ∩ T2 , x1 ∈ T1 ∩ B2 and x2 ∈ B1 ∩ T2 ,
which implies that N ({y1 , y2 }) ∩ (B1 ∩ B2 ) = {x3 }. Hence, applying Lemma 1 with the roles S and A replaced by {y1 , y2 } and
B1 ∩ B2 , respectively, we see that B1 ∩ B2 = {x3 }. Now we have x3 ∈ V5 , A = {y1 , y2 } ⊂ N (x3 ), and x1 , x2 ∈ N (x3 ), which
implies x3 ∈ Ad(x1 ; A) and x3 ∈ Ad(x2 ; A). Hence we have the desired conclusion that neither Ad(x1 ; A) nor Ad(x2 ; A) is
empty.
Next we consider the case that x3 ̸∈ S ∩ B2 . In this case, without loss of generality, we may assume that S ∩ B2 = {x1 , x4 }
and S ∩ B¯ 2 = {x3 , x5 }. Then we observe that x3 ∈ B1 ∩ B¯ 2 , x4 ∈ B¯ 1 ∩ B2 and x5 ∈ B¯ 1 ∩ B¯ 2 , which implies that neither B1 ∩ B¯ 2 nor
B¯ 1 ∩ B2 is empty. Then, Lemma 2(1) again assures us that both B1 ∩ B¯ 2 and B¯ 1 ∩ B2 are fragments of G. Moreover, we observe
that {y1 , y2 } ⊂ T1 ∩ T2 , x1 ∈ T1 ∩ B2 and x2 ∈ B1 ∩ T2 . Since N ({y1 , y2 }) ∩ (B1 ∩ B¯ 2 ) = {x3 }, applying Lemma 1 with the roles S
and A replaced by {y1 , y2 } and B1 ∩ B¯ 2 , respectively, we see that B1 ∩ B¯ 2 = {x3 }, which implies x3 ∈ V5 , A = {y1 , y2 } ⊂ N (x3 )
and x3 ∈ N (x2 ). Hence we see that x3 ∈ Ad(x2 ; A). We can similarly prove x4 ∈ Ad(x1 ; A). Now we obtain that neither
Ad(x1 ; A) nor Ad(x2 ; A) is empty.
In both cases, we have the desired conclusion that neither Ad(x1 ; A) nor Ad(x2 ; A) is empty and Claim 5.3 is proved.
By virtue of Claim 5.3, we show (1). Assume Ad(x1 ; A) = ∅. Then, by Claim 5.2, we see that x1 is tractable with A. If there
is a A-tractable vertex other than x1 , then Claim 5.3 assures us that Ad(x1 ; A) ̸= ∅, which contradicts the assumption that
Ad(x1 ; A) = ∅. Hence we see that none of x2 , x3 , x4 and x5 is A-tractable. Hence, again Claim 5.2 assures us that Ad(xi ; A) ̸= ∅
for i = 2, 3, 4, 5. Now (1) is proved.
Next we prove (2). Assume Ad(x1 ; A) = ∅ and N (x1 ) ∩ S ̸= ∅. Then, by (1), we know that Ad(xi ; A) ̸= ∅ for i = 2, 3, 4, 5.
Then, since Ad(x1 ; A) = ∅, Claim 5.2 assures us that x1 is A-tractable. Hence there is an (x1 ; A)-fit fragment B1 such
that |S ∩ B1 | = |S ∩ B¯ 1 | = 2. Since |S ∩ B1 | = |S ∩ B¯ 1 | = 2, we observe that S ∩ T1 = {x1 }, which implies that
|A¯ ∩ T1 | = |T1 | − |S ∩ T1 | − |A ∩ T1 | = 2. By symmetry, we may assume that S ∩ B1 = {x2 , x3 } and S ∩ B¯ 1 = {x4 , x5 }.
Note that, in this situation, EG ({x2 , x3 }, {x4 , x5 }) = ∅. Since N (x1 ) ∩ S ̸= ∅, without loss of generality, we may assume
x2 ∈ N (x1 ) ∩ S. Then, since Ad(x1 ; A) = ∅, we observe that either x2 ∈ V≥6 or |N (x2 ) ∩ A| = 1, which implies that x2
cannot be an admissible vertex of (x3 ; A). Since N (x3 ) ∩ S ⊂ {x1 , x2 }, x2 ̸∈ Ad(x3 ; A), and Ad(x3 ; A) ̸= ∅, we see that x1 is
an admissible vertex of (x3 ; A), which implies {y1 , y2 , x2 , x3 } ⊂ N (x1 ). Let N (x1 ) = {y1 , y2 , x2 , x3 , v}. Then, since neither
N (x1 ) ∩ A¯ nor N (x1 ) ∩ B¯ 1 is empty, we see that v ∈ A¯ ∩ B¯ 1 , which implies that |A¯ | ≥ |A¯ ∩ T1 | + |A¯ ∩ B¯ 1 | ≥ 3. Since
¯ respectively,
|A¯ | ≥ 3, |A| = 2 and |N (x1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, applying Corollary 4 with the roles of x, y and A replaced by x1 , v and A,
we see that Ad(x1 , v; A¯ ) ̸= ∅. Since N ({x2 , x3 }) ∩ B¯ 1 = ∅, we observe that v ̸∈ N ({x2 , x3 }), which implies that neither x2 nor
x3 is an admissible vertex of (x1 , v; A¯ ). Since N (x1 ) ∩ S = {x2 , x3 }, we have Ad(x1 , v; A¯ ) = ∅, which contradicts the previous
assertion. This contradiction proves (2).
At last we show (3). By (1), we know that |{x ∈ N (A) | Ad(x; A) ̸= ∅}| ≥ 4. To begin with the case that |{x ∈ N (A) |
Ad(x; A) ̸= ∅}| = 4, let Ad(x1 ; A) = ∅ and Ad(xi ; A) ̸= ∅ for i = 2, 3, 4, 5. By Claim 5.2, let B1 be an (x1 ; A)-fit fragment
such that |S ∩ B1 | = |S ∩ B¯ 1 | = 2. By symmetry, we may assume that S ∩ B1 = {x2 , x3 } and S ∩ B¯ 1 = {x4 , x5 }. By (2), we see
that N (x1 ) ∩ S = ∅. Then, since neither Ad(x2 ; A) nor Ad(x3 ; A) is empty, we see that x2 is an admissible vertex of (x3 ; A)
and x3 is an admissible vertex of (x2 ; A). Similarly we see that x4 is an admissible vertex of (x5 ; A) and x5 is an admissible
vertex of (x4 ; A). Now we have |S ∩ V5 | ≥ 4.
Hereafter, we assume that Ad(xi ; A) ̸= ∅ for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Assume |S ∩ V5 | ≤ 3, say x4 , x5 ∈ V≥6 . Since Ad(xi ; A) ̸= ∅
for i = 1, 2, 3, we observe that N (xi ) ∩ S ∩ V5 ̸= ∅ for i = 1, 2, 3. Hence we can find a path of length 2 in G[{x1 , x2 , x3 }]
whose center vertex has degree 5. Without loss of generality, we may assume that x1 x2 , x2 x3 ∈ E (G) and v2 ∈ V5 . We
show x2 ̸∈ Ad(x4 ; A). Assume x2 ∈ Ad(x4 ; A). Then, since x2 ∈ V5 , {x1 , x3 } ⊂ N (x2 ) and N (x2 ) ∩ A¯ ̸= ∅, we observe that
|N (x2 ) ∩ (A ∪ {x4 , x5 })| ≤ 2. Hence, we observe that either N (x2 ) ∩ {x4 , x5 } = ∅ or |N (x2 ) ∩ A| = 1. If N (x2 ) ∩ {x4 , x5 } = ∅,
then we observe that neither x2 ∈ Ad(x4 ; A) nor x2 ∈ Ad(x5 ; A). Otherwise, if |N (x2 ) ∩ A| = 1, then we also observe
that neither x2 ∈ Ad(x4 ; A) nor x2 ∈ Ad(x5 ; A). This contradicts the assumption and it is shown that x2 ̸∈ Ad(x4 ; A).
Since Ad(x4 ; A) ̸= ∅ and x2 , x5 ̸∈ Ad(x4 ; A), by symmetry, we may assume that x1 ∈ Ad(x4 ; A), which implies that
x1 ∈ V5 , {y1 , y2 , x2 , x4 } ⊂ N (x1 ) and |N (x1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, say N (x1 ) ∩ A¯ = {v1 }. Since N (x1 ) ∩ S = {x2 , x4 } and x4 ∈ V≥6 ,
we see that x2 ∈ Ad(x1 ; A), which implies that x2 ∈ V5 , {y1 , y2 , x1 , x4 } ⊂ N (x2 ) and |N (x2 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, say N (x2 ) ∩ A¯ = {v2 }.
Since Ad(x5 ; A) ̸= ∅ and N (x5 )∩{x1 , x2 } = ∅, we see that x3 ∈ Ad(x5 ; A), which implies that x3 ∈ V5 , {y1 , y2 , x2 , x5 } ⊂ N (x3 )
and |N (x3 )∩ A¯ | = 1, say N (x3 )∩ A¯ = {v3 }. If v1 = v2 , then, applying Lemma 1 with the roles of S and A replaced by {x1 , x2 } and
¯ respectively, we see that |A¯ | = 1, which contradicts the assumption that |A¯ | ≥ 2. Hence v1 ̸= v2 . By similar arguments,
A,
we know that v1 , v2 , v3 are distinct, which implies that |A¯ | ≥ 3. Since |A¯ | ≥ 3, |A| = 2 and |N (x1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, applying
¯ respectively, we see that Ad(x1 ; A¯ ) ̸= ∅. However, we already
Corollary 4 with the roles of x and A replaced by x1 and A,
know that N (x1 ) ∩ S = {x2 , x4 }, |N (x2 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1 and x4 ∈ V≥6 , which implies that there is no admissible vertex of (x1 ; A¯ ).
This contradicts the previous assertion and this contradiction proves (3) and Lemma 5 is proved.
The following is an immediate corollary from Lemmas 3 and 5.
Lemma 6. Let x be a vertex of a contraction-critically 5-connected graph. Let A be a fragment with respect to E (x) such that
|A¯ | ≥ 2. If N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, then there is an admissible vertex of (x; A).

Proof. We prove Lemma 6 by induction on |A|. Note that |A| ≥ 2, since N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅. If |A| = 2, then, since |A¯ | ≥ 2
and N (x) ∩ N (A) ̸= ∅, Lemma 5(2) assures us that there is an admissible vertex of (x; A). Now the initial step is completed.
Next assume |A| ≥ 3 and let y ∈ N (x) ∩ A. If there is an admissible vertex of (x, y; A), then we are done. Hence, assume
that Ad(x, y; A) = ∅. Then, by Lemma 3, we see that there is an xy-fragment A′ such that A′
A. Then we see that A′ is
′
′
′
¯
¯
an E (x)-fragment, |A | > |A| ≥ 2, N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅ and |A | < |A|. Hence, by the induction hypothesis, we see that
Ad(x; A′ ) ̸= ∅. Since A′
A and N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, we see that an admissible vertex of (x; A′ ) is an admissible vertex of
(x; A). The induction step is now completed and Lemma 6 is proved.
Lemma 7. Let x be a vertex of a contraction-critically 5-connected graph G. Let A be a fragment with respect to E (x) such that
|A¯ | ≥ 2 and |A| ≥ 3. Suppose |N (x) ∩ A| = 1, say N (x) ∩ A = {y}. If y ̸∈ V5 , then there is a strongly admissible vertex of (x, y; A).
Proof. Assume that there is no strongly admissible vertex of (x, y; A). By Corollary 4, we know that Ad(x, y; A) ̸= ∅, say
z ∈ Ad(x, y; A). Let B = {z } and T = N (z ). By the assumption, z is not strongly admissible, which implies |N (z ) ∩ A¯ | ≥ 2.
Since |N (z ) ∩ A| ≥ 2 and |N (z ) ∩ A¯ | ≥ 2, we observe that |N (z ) ∩ A| = |N (z ) ∩ A¯ | = 2 and S ∩ T = {x}. Let N (z ) ∩ A = {y, u}
and S ∩ B¯ = {v1 , v2 , v3 }.
Claim 7.1. |A| = 3.
Proof. Assume |A| ≥ 4. Let A′ = A − {y} and S ′ = (S − {x}) ∪ {y}. Then we observe that A′ is a zy-fragment, |A¯ ′ | >
|A¯ | ≥ 2, |A′ | = |A| − 1 ≥ 3 and N (z ) ∩ A′ = {u}. Hence, by Corollary 4, we see that there is an admissible vertex of (z , u; A′ ).
But we know that N (z ) ∩ S ′ = {y} and y ∈ V≥6 , which implies that there is no admissible vertex of (z , u; A′ ). This contradicts
the previous assertion and it is shown that |A| = 3.
Let A = {y, u, w}, then A ∩ T = {y, u} and A ∩ B¯ = {w}. In this situation, since N (x) ∩ (A ∩ B¯ ) = ∅, we observe that
w ∈ V5 and N (w) = {y, u, v1 , v2 , v3 }. Let A′ = {u, w} and let S ′ = N (A′ ) = {z , y, v1 , v2 , v3 }.
Claim 7.2. z is tractable with A′ .
Proof. Assume z is not tractable with A′ . Let C be a zu-fragment. Since S ′ − {z } = {y, v1 , v2 , v3 } ⊂ N (w), we observe that
C is a (z ; A′ )-fit fragment. Since z is not tractable with A′ , we see that either |S ′ ∩ C | ≤ 1 or |S ′ ∩ C | ≤ 1. Without loss of
generality, we may assume that |S ′ ∩ C | ≤ 1. Since C is (z ; A′ )-fit, we know that S ′ ∩ C ̸= ∅, which implies |S ′ ∩ C | = 1,
say S ′ ∩ C = {y′ }. Then, since |S ′ ∩ C | < |A′ ∩ N (C )| = |A′ | = 2, Lemma 2(2) assures us that A¯ ′ ∩ C = ∅, which implies
C = S ′ ∩ C = {y′ }. Then, we observe that y′ ∈ N (z ) ∩ S ′ ∩ V5 , which contradicts the fact that N (z ) ∩ S ′ = {y} and y ̸∈ V5 .
This contradiction proves Claim 7.2.
Let C be a zu-fragment. By Claim 7.2, we know that A′ ⊂ N (C ), |S ′ ∩ C | = |S ′ ∩ C¯ | = 2 and S ′ ∩ N (C ) = {z }. Without loss
of generality, we may assume that S ′ ∩ C = {y, v1 } and S ′ ∩ C¯ = {v2 , v3 }. Then, we observe that N (y) ∩ {v2 , v3 } = ∅, which
implies that N (y) ⊂ (S ∪ A) − {y, v2 , v3 } = {x, z , u, w, v1 }. Now we have degG (y) = |N (y)| ≤ 5, which contradicts the fact
that y ∈ V≥6 . This contradiction proves Lemma 7.
3. Proof of Proposition 1
Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph and let x ∈ V (G) such that x ̸∈ V5 and |N (x) ∩ V5 | = 2, say
N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }. By way of contradiction, assume y1 y2 ∈ E (G). Let E ′ (x) = E (x) − {xy1 , xy2 }. Let A be a E ′ (x)-fragment
of G. Then, since y1 y2 ∈ E (G), we observe that either A ∩ {y1 , y2 } = ∅ or A¯ ∩ {y1 , y2 } = ∅. Hence there is a {y1 , y2 }-free
E ′ (x)-fragment of G.
Claim 1. Let xz ∈ E ′ (x) and let A be a minimal {y1 , y2 }-free xz-fragment.
Then, (1) A¯ ∩ {y1 , y2 } ̸= ∅ and (2) if |A¯ | ≥ 2, then |A| ≥ 3.
Proof. (1) Assume that A¯ ∩ {y1 , y2 } = ∅. Then {y1 , y2 } ⊂ N (A). Then, since N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, we observe that |A| ≥ 2.
Since N (x) ∩ A¯ ∩ V5 = ∅, we also see that |A¯ | ≥ 2. We show that |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2. Assume |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 1, say
N (y1 ) ∩ A = {u}. Let A′ = A − {u}. Then we see that A′ is a {y1 , y2 }-free xz-fragment of G and A′
A, which contradicts
the minimality of A. This contradiction proves that |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2. By symmetry, we have |N (y2 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2. Hence
|N (y1 ) ∩ (N (A) ∪ A)| ≥ |{x, y2 }| + |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 4, which implies |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1. Similarly we have |N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1.
Hence, we see that {y1 , y2 } ∩ Ad(x; A¯ ) = ∅. Since N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }, this implies that Ad(x; A¯ ) = ∅. On the other hand,
since |A| ≥ 2 and N (x) ∩ A¯ ∩ V5 = ∅, Lemma 6 assures us that there is an admissible vertex of (x; A¯ ), which contradicts the
previous assertion. This contradiction proves (1).
(2) Assume that |A¯ | ≥ 2 and |A| ≤ 2. Since N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 } and A is {y1 , y2 }-free, we observe that N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅,
which implies A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅ and |A| ≥ 2. Hence we see that |A| = 2. Since |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| = 2 and A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅, applying
Lemma 5(3), we see that |N (A) ∩ V5 | ≥ 4. However, since {x, z } ⊂ N (A) ∩ V≥6 , we observe that |N (A) ∩ V5 | ≤ 3, which
contradicts the previous assertion. This contradiction shows (2) and Claim 1 is proved.
Claim 2. There is a yi -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment of G for each i ∈ {1, 2}.

Proof. Let A be a minimal {y1 , y2 }-free E ′ (x)-fragment of G and let S = N (A). Then Claim 1 assures us that A¯ ∩ {y1 , y2 } ̸= ∅.
Hence, by symmetry, we may assume that A is a minimal y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment of G. Say xz ∈ E (S ) ∩ E ′ (x). Since
N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, we see that |A| ≥ 2. Assume that there is no y2 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment. Let u ∈ N (x) ∩ A and let B be
a minimal {y1 , y2 }-free xu-fragment of G. Then, since N (x) ∩ B ∩ V5 = ∅, we observe that |B| ≥ 2. Applying Claim 1 with
the roles of xz and A replaced by xu and B, respectively, we see that {y1 , y2 } ∩ B¯ ̸= ∅, which implies y1 ∈ A¯ ∩ B¯ since B is
not a y2 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment. Since both A and B are {y1 , y2 }-free and neither A nor B is y2 -opposite, we observe that
y2 ∈ S ∩ T .
Subclaim 2.1. (1) A ∩ B = ∅ and (2) |S ∩ B| = 1.
Proof. (1) Assume A ∩ B ̸= ∅. Then, since neither A ∩ B nor A¯ ∩ B¯ is empty, Lemma 2(1) assures us that A ∩ B is y1 -opposite
E ′ (x)-fragment, which contradicts the minimality of A since u ̸∈ A ∩ B. This contradiction proves (1).
(2) Assume |S ∩ B| ≥ 2. Then, since A¯ ∩ B¯ ̸= ∅, Lemma 2(2) assures us |A¯ ∩ T | ≥ |S ∩ B| ≥ 2, which implies |A ∩ T | = 1
since {x, y2 } ⊂ S ∩ T . Hence, we observe that |A ∩ T | < |S ∩ B| and again Lemma 2(2) assures us that A ∩ B¯ = ∅, which
implies that |A| = |A ∩ T | = 1. This contradicts the fact that |A| ≥ 2 and it is shown that |S ∩ B| = 1.
By Subclaim 2.1, we know that A ∩ B = ∅ and |S ∩ B| = 1, which implies A¯ ∩ B ̸= ∅ since |B| ≥ 2. Hence, by Lemma 2(2),
we see that |A ∩ T | ≤ |S ∩ B| = 1, which implies A ∩ B¯ ̸= ∅ since |A| ≥ 2. Now we observe that neither A¯ ∩ B nor A ∩ B¯
is empty. Hence, by Lemma 2(1), we see that A ∩ B¯ is a y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment, which contradicts the minimality of A
¯ This contradiction shows the existence of a y2 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment and Claim 2 is proved.
since u ̸∈ A ∩ B.
Let A be a minimum y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment and let B be a minimum y2 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment. Let S = N (A) and
let T = N (B).
Claim 3. |A¯ | ≥ 2 and |B¯ | ≥ 2.
Proof. We show |A¯ | ≥ 2. Assume |A¯ | = 1. Then A¯ = {y1 } and S = N (y1 ). Let S = N (y1 ) = {x, y2 , z1 , z2 , z3 }. Let
B′ = G − N (y2 ) ∪ {y2 } and let T ′ = N (B′ ). Then B¯ ′ = {y2 }. Let T ′ = N (y2 ) = {x, y1 , u1 , u2 , u3 }. By Theorem E, we know that
|N (y1 ) ∩ V5 | ≥ 2 and |N (y2 ) ∩ V5 | ≥ 2. Hence, since x ̸∈ V5 , we observe that neither {z1 , z2 , z3 } ∩ V5 nor {u1 , u2 , u3 } ∩ V5 is
empty. Without loss of generality, we may assume z3 , u3 ∈ V5 .
Subclaim 3.1. N (x) ⊂ S ∪ T ′ ∪ {y1 , y2 }.
Proof. Assume N (x) ∩ (A ∩ B′ ) ̸= ∅. Let E ′′ (x) = EG (x, A ∩ B′ ). Then E ′′ (x) ̸= ∅. Let C be a minimum {y1 , y2 }-free E ′′ (x)fragment. Say xv ∈ E (N (C )) ∩ EG (x, A ∩ B′ ). Note that v ∈ V≥6 since N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }. Since v ∈ A ∩ B′ , A¯ = {y1 }
and B¯ ′ = {y2 }, we observe that N (v) ∩ {y1 , y2 } = ∅. Then, applying Claim 1 with the role of A replaced by C , we see
that {y1 , y2 } ∩ C¯ ̸= ∅. Since v ∈ N (C ) and N (v) ∩ {y1 , y2 } = ∅, we see that |C¯ | ≥ 2. If y1 ∈ C¯ , then we observe that
A¯ ∩ N (C ) = A¯ ∩ C = S ∩ C = ∅, which implies that C is a y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment such that C ⊂ A − {v}. This contradicts
the minimality of A. Hence y1 ̸∈ C¯ , which implies that y2 ∈ S ∩ C¯ and y1 ∈ N (C ). Since |C¯ | ≥ 2, applying Claim 1(2) with the
roles of A and E ′ (x) replaced by C and E ′′ (x), respectively, we see that |C | ≥ 3. Since |C¯ | ≥ 2, |C | ≥ 3 and N (x) ∩ C ∩ V5 = ∅,
applying Lemma 6 with the role of A replaced by C , we see that Ad(x; C ) ̸= ∅. Since N (x) ∩ N (C ) ∩ V5 = {y1 }, we observe
that y1 is an admissible vertex of (x; C ), which implies that |N (y1 ) ∩ C | = |S ∩ C | ≥ 2.
Subsubclaim 3.1.1. |S ∩ C¯ | ≥ 2.
Proof. Assume |S ∩ C¯ | = 1. Then, since |C¯ | ≥ 2, we observe that A ∩ C¯ ̸= ∅. Then, since |S ∩ C¯ | = |A¯ ∩ N (C )|, applying
Lemma 2(2), we see that |(S ∩ C¯ )∪(S ∩ N (C ))∪(A ∩ N (C ))| = 5. Hence we observe that A ∩ C¯ is a y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment,
which contradicts the minimality of A since v ̸∈ A ∩ C¯ . This contradiction proves Subsubclaim 3.1.1.
Since |N (y1 ) ∩ C | = |S ∩ C | ≥ 2, Subsubclaim 3.1.1 assures us that |S ∩ C | = |S ∩ C¯ | = 2 and S ∩ N (C ) = {x}.
Subsubclaim 3.1.2. N (x) ∩ (A ∩ C ) = ∅.
Proof. Assume v ′ ∈ N (x) ∩ (A ∩ C ). Then, there is no admissible vertex of (x, v ′ ; C ) since N (x) ∩ N (C ) ∩ V5 = {y1 } and
y1 v ′ ̸∈ E (G). Then, since |C¯ | ≥ 2, |C | ≥ 3 and Ad(x, v ′ ; C ) = ∅, applying Lemma 3 with the roles of y and A replaced by v ′
and C , respectively, we see that there is an xv ′ -fragment C ′ such that C ′
C , which contradicts the minimality of C . This
contradiction shows that N (x) ∩ (A ∩ C ) = ∅.
Subsubclaim 3.1.2 assures us that N (x) ∩ C ⊂ S ∩ C .
Subsubclaim 3.1.3. N (x) ∩ C = S ∩ C .
Proof. Assume N (x)∩C
S ∩C . Then, since |S ∩C | = 2, we observe that |N (x)∩C | = 1. Since |C¯ | ≥ 2, |C | ≥ 3, |N (x)∩C | = 1
and N (x) ∩ C ⊂ V≥6 , applying Lemma 7 with the role of A replaced by C , we see that y1 is a strongly admissible vertex of
(x; C ). Hence |N (y1 ) ∩ C¯ | = 1, which contradicts Subsubclaim 3.1.1. This contradiction proves N (x) ∩ C = S ∩ C .
We are in a position to complete the proof of Subclaim 3.1. By Subsubclaim 3.1.3, we know N (x) ∩ C = N (y1 ) ∩ C , which
implies that N (y1 ) ∩ C ∩ V5 = ∅ since N (x) ∩ C ∩ V5 = ∅. Since |C¯ | ≥ 2, |C | ≥ 3 and N (y1 ) ∩ C ∩ V5 = ∅, applying
Lemma 6 with the roles of x and A replaced by y1 and C , respectively, we see that Ad(y1 ; C ) ̸= ∅. On the other hand, since
N (y1 ) ∩ N (C ) = {x} and x ∈ V≥6 , we see that there is no admissible vertex of (y1 ; C ), which contradicts the previous
assertion. This contradiction proves Subclaim 3.1.

By Subclaim 3.1 we know that N (x) ⊂ (S ∪ T ′ ) ∪ {y1 , y2 }. Since N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 } and z3 , u3 ∈ V5 , we see that
z3 , u3 ̸∈ N (x). Hence, we observe that y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 , u1 , u2 are distinct and N (x) = {y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 , u1 , u2 } because |N (x)| ≥ 6.
Hence, we observe that {z1 , z2 , u1 , u2 } ∩ V5 = ∅ since N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }.
Subclaim 3.2. Let C be a y1 x-fragment such that |S ∩ C | ≥ |S ∩ C¯ | and |S ∩ N (C )| ≥ 2. Then, either (1) C¯ = {y2 } or (2)
{z1 , z2 } ⊂ C and z3 = u3 .
Proof. Since A¯ = {y1 } and y1 ∈ N (C ), we observe that neither S ∩ C nor S ∩ C¯ is empty. Hence, since |S ∩ C | ≥ |S ∩ C¯ | and
|S ∩ N (C )| ≥ 2, we see that |S ∩ C¯ | = 1, say S ∩ C¯ = {v}.
At first we consider the case that A ∩ C¯ = ∅. In this case C¯ = S ∩ C¯ = {v}. Hence v ∈ N (x) ∩ S ∩ V5 , which implies that
v = y2 . Now it is shown that if A ∩ C¯ = ∅, then (1) holds.
Next we assume A ∩ C¯ ̸= ∅. In this case, since |A¯ ∩ N (C )| = |S ∩ C¯ |, we see that A ∩ C¯ is a fragment of G. If |A ∩ C¯ | = 1,
then N (x) ∩ (A ∩ B¯ ) ∩ V5 ̸= ∅, which contradicts the fact that A is {y1 , y2 }-free. Hence |A ∩ C¯ | ≥ 2, which implies |C¯ | ≥ 3.
Since S ∩ C ̸= ∅ and |A ∩ N (C )| = |S ∩ C |, we observe that A ∩ C¯
A. If {z1 , z2 } ∩ (N (C ) ∪ C¯ ) ̸= ∅, then we observe that
A ∩ C¯ is a y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment, which contradicts the minimality of A. Hence we have {z1 , z2 } ⊂ C . Since {z1 , z2 } ⊂ C ,
we observe that |C | ≥ 2 and either w = y2 or w = z3 . Now we know that |C | ≥ 2, |C¯ | ≥ 3 and N (y1 ) ∩ C¯ = {w}. Hence,
applying Corollary 4 with the roles of x and A replaced by y1 and C¯ , respectively, we see that Ad(y1 , w; C¯ ) ̸= ∅. If w = z3 ,
then y2 is an admissible vertex of (y1 , z3 ; C¯ ), which implies that y2 z3 ∈ E (G). If w = y2 , then z3 is an admissible vertex of
(y1 , y2 ; C¯ ), which again implies that y2 z3 ∈ E (G). Thus we have z3 = u3 . Now it is shown that if A ∩ C¯ ̸= ∅, then (2) holds
and Subclaim 3.2 is proved.
Subclaim 3.3. z3 = u3 .
Proof. Let C be a y1 z3 -fragment. Then, if x ∈ C , then, since N (y1 ) ⊂ N (x) ∪ {x, z3 }, we observe that N (y1 ) ∩ C¯ = ∅, which
contradicts the choice of C . Hence x ̸∈ C . By symmetry, we see that x ̸∈ C¯ and hence x ∈ N (C ), which implies that C is a
y1 x-fragment and |S ∩ N (C )| ≥ 2. Without loss of generality, we may assume that |S ∩ C | ≥ |S ∩ C¯ |. Now we can apply
Subclaim 2.2. If Subclaim (2) holds, then z3 = u3 and we are done. Hence, we may assume that Subclaim 2.2(1) holds, that
is C¯ = {y2 }. Thus y2 z3 ∈ E (G), which implies again z3 = u3 . Subclaim 3.3 is proved.
We proceed with the proof of Claim 3. By Subclaim 3.3, we know that z3 = u3 , say w = z3 = u3 . Since w ∈ V5 , and
{y1 , y2 } ⊂ N (w), we see that |{z1 , z2 , u1 , u2 } ∩ N (w)| ≤ 3. Without loss of generality, we may assume that z1 ̸∈ N (w). Let
C be a fragment with respect to y1 z1 . We show that x ∈ N (C ). Assume x ∈ C . Then we observe that N (y1 ) ∩ C¯ = {w} since
N (y1 ) ⊂ N (x) ∪ {x, w}. Since xy2 , y2 w ∈ E (G), we observe that y2 ∈ N (C ). Furthermore, since {z1 , z2 , u1 , u2 } ⊂ N (x), we
see that N ({y1 , y2 }) ∩ C¯ = {w}. Hence, applying Lemma 1 with the roles of S and A replaced by {y1 , y2 } and C¯ , respectively,
we see that C¯ = {w} and N (C ) = N (w). This contradicts the fact that z1 ̸∈ N (w), and this contradiction proves x ̸∈ C . By
symmetry, we see that x ̸∈ C¯ . Now it is shown that x ∈ N (C ).
Without loss of generality, we may assume that |S ∩ C | ≥ |S ∩ C¯ |. Applying Subclaim 3.2, we see that C¯ = {y2 } since
the fact that z1 ∈ N (C ) assures us that Subclaim 3.2(2) does not occur. Hence, we observe that y2 z1 ∈ E (G). However
N (y2 ) = {x, y1 , u1 , u2 , w} and y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 , u1 , u2 are distinct, which implies y2 z1 ̸∈ E (G). This contradicts the previous
assertion and we have shown that |A¯ | ≥ 2.
Using the same arguments with the roles of A and B′ replaced by B and G − N (y1 ) ∪ {y1 }, respectively, we can show that
|B¯ | ≥ 2. Now Claim 3 is proved.
Recall that A and B are a minimum y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment and a minimum y2 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment, respectively,
and S = N (A) and T = N (B). By Claim 3, we know that |A¯ |, |B¯ | ≥ 2. Then, applying Claim 1(2), we see that |A|, |B| ≥ 3.
Claim 4. (1) N (x) ∩ A ⊂ N (y2 ) ∩ A and (2) N (x) ∩ B ⊂ N (y1 ) ∩ B.
Proof. We show (1). Assume that there is a vertex v ∈ N (x) ∩ A such that v ̸∈ N (y2 ). Since N (x) ∩ S ∩ V5 = {y2 }, there is no
admissible vertex of (x, v; A). Then, since |A¯ | ≥ 2 and |A| ≥ 3, applying Lemma 3 with the role y replaced by v , we see that
there is an xv -fragment A′ such that A′
A. Then A′ is a y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment such that A′
A, which contradicts that
minimality of A. This contradiction shows (1).
By the similar arguments, we can show (2) and Claim 4 is proved.
Since A is y1 -opposite and B is y2 -opposite, Claim 4 assures us that N (x) ∩ (A ∩ B) = ∅.
Claim 5. Neither A¯ ∩ B nor A ∩ B¯ is empty.
Proof. Assume that either A¯ ∩ B = ∅ or A ∩ B¯ = ∅. Without loss of generality, we may assume that A¯ ∩ B = ∅. We show
A ∩ B = ∅. Assume A ∩ B ̸= ∅. Then, since N (x) ∩ (A ∩ B) = ∅, we observe that |(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (S ∩ T )| ≥ 6. Then
Lemma 2(1) assures us that A¯ ∩ B¯ = ∅, which implies A¯ = A¯ ∩ T . Since |A¯ ∩ T | = |A¯ | ≥ 2, by Lemma 2(2), we observe that
|S ∩ B| ≥ |A¯ ∩ T | + 1 = 3, which implies |S ∩ B¯ | = |S | − |S ∩ T | − |S ∩ B| ≤ 1. Then we observe that |S ∩ B¯ | < |A¯ ∩ T |
and Lemma 2(2) again assures us that A ∩ B¯ = ∅, which implies that |B¯ | = |S ∩ B¯ | ≤ 1. This contradicts Claim 3 and it
is shown that A ∩ B = ∅. Since A ∩ B = ∅, A¯ ∩ B = ∅ and |B| ≥ 3, we observe that |S ∩ B| = |B| ≥ 3. Next we show
that |A ∩ T | ≥ 3. Assume |A ∩ T | ≤ 2. Then, |A ∩ T | < |S ∩ B| and Lemma 2(2) assures us that A ∩ B¯ = ∅, which implies
|A| = |A ∩ T | ≤ 2. This contradicts the assertion before Claim 4, and it is shown that |A ∩ T | ≥ 3. Since |A ∩ T | ≥ 3, we
observe that |A¯ ∩ T | = |T | − |S ∩ T | − |A ∩ T | ≤ 1. Hence, since |A¯ ∩ T | < |S ∩ B|, we see that A¯ ∩ B¯ = ∅, which implies that
A¯ = A¯ ∩ T . Thus |A¯ | = |A¯ ∩ T | ≤ 1, which contradicts Claim 3. This contradiction proves Claim 5.

By Claim 5 we know that neither A¯ ∩ B nor A ∩ B¯ is empty. Then, Lemma 2(1) assures us that both A¯ ∩ B and A ∩ B¯ are
fragments of G. We show that S ∩ B = A ∩ B = A ∩ T = ∅. Since A is an E ′ (x)-fragment, E (S )∩ E ′ (x) ̸= ∅, say xz ∈ E (S )∩ E ′ (x).
¯ which implies
If z ∈ S ∩ (T ∪ B¯ ), then A ∩ B¯ is a y1 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment. Then, the minimality of A assures us A = A ∩ B,
that S ∩ B = A ∩ B = A ∩ T = ∅. Hence, z ∈ S ∩ B, which implies that A¯ ∩ B is a y2 -opposite E ′ (x)-fragment. In this
case, the minimality of B assures us B = A¯ ∩ B, which implies again that S ∩ B = A ∩ B = A ∩ T = ∅. Now we know that
A = A ∩ B¯ , B = A¯ ∩ B and S ∩ B = A ∩ B = A ∩ T = ∅. Since A = A ∩ B¯ , B = A¯ ∩ B and |A|, |B| ≥ 3, we see that |A¯ |, |B¯ | ≥ 3.
Claim 6. N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ = {y1 }, N (y1 ) ∩ B¯ = {y2 },

¯ it suffices to show that |N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1. If |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 3,
Proof. We show that N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ = {y1 }. Since y1 ∈ N (y2 ) ∩ A,
then |N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ | = |N (y2 )| − |N (y2 ) ∩ S | − |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 1 and we are done. Hence we may assume that |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 2.
Then, by Claim 4, we observe that |N (x) ∩ A| ≤ |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 2. If |N (x) ∩ A| = 1, then we see that y2 is a strongly admissible
vertex of (x; A), which implies that |N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1. Hence we may assume that |N (x) ∩ A| = 2. In this situation, by Claim
4, we see that N (x) ∩ A = N (y2 ) ∩ A, which implies that N (y2 ) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅ since N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅. Since |A¯ | ≥ 2 and
N (y2 ) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, applying Lemma 6 with the role of x replaced by y2 , we see that Ad(y2 ; A) ̸= ∅, which implies that y2
has a neighbor other than x in S. Thus we observe that |N (y2 ) ∩ S | ≥ 2, which implies that |N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1. Hence, it is
shown N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ = {y1 }.
By the similar arguments, we can show that N (y1 ) ∩ B¯ = {y2 }, and Claim 6 is proved.
¯
Since |A¯ |, |A| ≥ 3 and N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ = {y1 }, applying Corollary 4 with the roles of x, y and A replaced by y2 , y1 and A,
respectively, we see that Ad(y2 , y1 ; A¯ ) ̸= ∅. Since |B¯ |, |B| ≥ 3 and N (y1 ) ∩ B¯ = {y2 }, applying Corollary 4 with the roles
¯ respectively, we also see that Ad(y1 , y2 ; B¯ ) ̸= ∅. Say w ∈ Ad(y2 , y1 ; A¯ ). Then, since
of x, y and A replaced by y1 , y2 and B,
w ∈ N (y1 ) ∩ N (y2 ), we observe that N (y2 ) = (N (y2 ) ∩ A) ∪ {x, w, y1 } and N (y1 ) = (N (y1 ) ∩ B) ∪ {x, w, y2 }, which implies
w ∈ N (y1 ) ∩ N (y2 ) and Ad(y2 , y1 ; A¯ ) = Ad(y1 , y2 ; A¯ ) = {w}.
Claim 7. |N (w) ∩ A| ≥ 2 and |N (w) ∩ B| ≥ 2.
Proof. We show |N (w) ∩ A| ≥ 2. Assume |N (w) ∩ A| = 1, say N (w) ∩ A = {u1 }.
Subclaim 7.1. |N (x) ∩ A| = 1.
Proof. Assume |N (x) ∩ A| = 2. Then, since |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 2, Claim 4 assures us that N (y2 ) ∩ A = N (x) ∩ A, which implies
N (y2 ) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅ since N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅. Since |A¯ | ≥ 3, applying Lemma 6 with the role of x replaced by y2 , we
see that Ad(y2 ; A) ̸= ∅. Since N (y2 ) ∩ S ∩ V5 = {w}, we observe that w is an admissible vertex of (y2 ; A), which implies
|N (w) ∩ A| ≥ 2. This contradicts the assumption and Subclaim 7.1 is proved.
By Subclaim 7.1, we know that |N (x) ∩ A| = 1, say N (x) ∩ A = {u2 }. We show that u1 ̸= u2 . Assume u1 = u2 . Then, since
N ({x, w}) ∩ A = {u1 }, applying Lemma 1 with the role S replaced by {x, w}, we see that A = {u1 }, which contradicts the fact
that |A| ≥ 3. Now it is shown that u1 ̸= u2 .
Subclaim 7.2. |A| ≥ 4.
Proof. Assume |A| = 3. Recall that zx ∈ E (S ) ∩ E ′ (x). Since w ∈ V5 , we observe that z ̸= w . Let A1 = A − {u1 }. Then, since
N (w) ∩ A = {u1 }, we observe that N (A1 ) = (S − {w}) ∪ {u1 }. This implies that A1 is a fragment of G. Since |A| = 3 and
u2 ∈ A1 ∩ V≥6 , we observe that |A1 | = 2 and A1 ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅. Then, since |A¯ 1 | ≥ 3, |A1 | = 2 and A1 ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅, applying
Lemma 5(3) with the role of A replaced by A1 , we see that |N (A1 ) ∩ V5 | ≥ 4. However, since {x, z } ⊂ N (A1 ) ∩ V≥6 , we observe
that |N (A1 ) ∩ V≥6 | ≥ 2, which implies that |N (A2 ) ∩ V5 | ≤ 3. This contradicts the previous assertion. and Subclaim 7.2 is
proved.
Recall that N (x) ∩ A = {u2 } and y2 is an admissible vertex of (x, u2 ; A). Hence, we observe that u2 ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y2 ) ∩ A.
Let A2 = A − {u2 }. Then A2 is a fragment of G since N (x) ∩ A = {u2 }. Subclaim 7.2 assures us that |A| ≥ 4, which implies that
|A2 | ≥ 3. Since |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 2 and u2 ∈ N (y2 ) ∩ A, we observe that |N (y2 ) ∩ A2 | = 1. Then, since |A¯ 2 | ≥ 2, |A2 | ≥ 3 and
|N (y2 ) ∩ A2 | = 1, applying Corollary 4 with the roles x and A replaced by y2 and A2 , respectively, we see that Ad(y2 ; A2 ) ̸= ∅.
Then, since N (y2 ) ∩ S ∩ V5 = {w}, w is an admissible vertex of (y2 ; A2 ), which implies |N (w) ∩ A2 | ≥ 2. This contradicts the
assumption that |N (w) ∩ A| = 1. This contradiction proves |N (w) ∩ A| ≥ 2.
By the similar arguments, we can show |N (w) ∩ B| ≥ 2 and Claim 7 is proved.
We are in a position to complete the proof of Proposition 1. Claim 7 assures us that |N (w) ∩ A| ≥ 2 and |N (w) ∩ B| ≥ 2.
Since A ∩ B = ∅, we observe that |N (w) ∩ (A ∪ B)| = |N (w) ∩ A| + |N (w) ∩ B| ≥ 4. Since {y1 , y2 } ⊂ N (w) and both A and
B are {y1 , y2 }-free, we see that |N (w)| ≥ |N (w) ∩ (A ∪ B ∪ {y1 , y2 })| = |N (w) ∩ (A ∪ B)| + |N (w) ∩ {y1 , y2 }| ≥ 6, which
contradicts the fact that w ∈ V5 . This is the final contradiction and the proof of Proposition 1 is completed.
4. Proof of Proposition 2
In this section we prove Proposition 2.
Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph. Let x be a vertex of G such that x ̸∈ V5 and |N (x) ∩ V5 | = 2. Let
N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }. Then, Proposition 1 assures us that y1 y2 ̸∈ E (G).

Claim 1. |G| ≥ 10.
Proof. Assume |G| ≤ 9. Let A be a {y2 }-free xy1 -fragment and let S = N (A). Then, since N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, we observe that
¯ then we also see that |A¯ | ≥ 2 since
|A| ≥ 2. If A¯ ∩{y2 } = ∅, then, by the same reason, we see that |A¯ | ≥ 2. Otherwise, if y2 ∈ A,
y1 y2 ̸∈ E (G). Hence, since |G| ≤ 9, we observe that |A| = |A¯ | = 2. Let A = {u1 , u2 } and A¯ = {v1 , v2 }. Then, since |A| = |A¯ | = 2
and A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅, applying Lemma 5, we see that |S ∩ V5 | ≥ 4, which implies that S −{x} ⊂ V5 . Since x ̸∈ V5 and |A ∪ A¯ | = 4, we
observe that |N (x)∩ S | ≥ 2, which implies N (x)∩ S = {y1 , y2 } and N (x) = {y1 , y2 , u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 }. Let S = {x, y1 , y2 , w1 , w2 }.
Since N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }, we observe that {u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 } ⊂ V≥6 , which implies that S ⊂ N (u1 ) ∩ N (u2 ) ∩ N (v1 ) ∩ N (v2 ).
Hence, we see that N (y1 ) = N (y2 ) = {x, u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 }, which implies N ({w1 , w2 }) = {u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 }. This contradicts the
assumption that G is 5-connected. This contradiction proves Claim 1.
We start with the following observation, which has a somewhat technical appearance but is useful.
Claim 2. Let y ∈ {y1 , y2 }. Let A be an xy-fragment such that |A¯ | ≥ 2 and |A| ≥ 3. Suppose |N (y) ∩ A| = 2, N (y) ∩ N (A) = {x}
and N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ A ̸= ∅. Then, for each u ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ A, there is an xy-fragment A′ such that A′
A and N (y) ∩ A′ = {u}.
Proof. Let S = N (A). Let N (y) ∩ A = {u, u′ } and u ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ A. Since N (y) ∩ S = {x} and x ̸∈ V5 , there is no admissible
vertex of (y, u′ ; A). Hence, since |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3 and Ad(y, u′ ; A) = ∅, applying Lemma 3 with the roles of x and y replaced
by y and u′ , respectively, we see that there is a yu′ -fragment A′ such that A′
A. Since N (y) ∩ A′ ̸= ∅, N (y) ∩ A = {u, u′ } and
A′
A, we observe that N (y) ∩ A′ = {u}. Since x ̸∈ A, A′
A, u ∈ A′ and xu ∈ E (G), we see that x ∈ N (A′ ), which implies
that A′ is an xy-fragment. Hence A′ is a desired fragment and Claim 2 is proved.
Claim 3. There is a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment.
Proof. Assume that there is no y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment. Let A be a fragment with respect to xy1 and let S = N (A). Then,
since neither A nor A¯ is y2 -opposite, we observe that {x, y1 , y2 } ⊂ S, which implies N (x) ∩ V5 ⊂ S. Hence we see that
N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = N (x) ∩ A¯ ∩ V5 = ∅, which implies |A|, |A¯ | ≥ 2. We choose a fragment A with respect to xy1 so that
|N (y1 ) ∩ A| is as small as possible. Furthermore, subject to the above condition, we choose A so that |A| is as large as possible.
Subclaim 3.1. |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = |N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ | = 2.
Proof. Assume |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 1, say N (y2 ) ∩ A = {u}. Then, since |A| ≥ 2, S ′ = (S − {y2 }) ∪ {u} is a 5-cutset of G and
A − {u} is a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment, which contradicts the assumption. Hence |N (y2 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2. By symmetry, we see that
|N (y2 ) ∩ A¯ | ≥ 2. Since x ∈ N (y2 ) ∩ S and |N (y2 )| = 5, we have the desired conclusion.
Subclaim 3.2. (1) |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≤ 2. Furthermore, if |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 2, then |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 2 and |A| ≥ |A¯ |, (2) |A| ≥ 3.
Proof. (1) By the choice of A, we know that |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≤ |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ |. Since x ∈ N (y1 ) ∩ S and |N (y1 )| = 5, we observe that
|N (y1 ) ∩ A| + |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | ≤ 4. Hence, since |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≤ |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ |, we see that |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≤ 2. Now the former part of
(1) is shown. Next assume that |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 2. Then, since |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≤ |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | and x ∈ N (y1 ) ∩ S, we observe that
|N (y1 ) ∩ A| = |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 2. Hence, by the choice of A, we see that |A| ≥ |A¯ | and the latter part of (1) is proved.
(2) Assume |A| = 2, say A = {u, u′ }. If y1 u ̸∈ E (G), then u ∈ V5 and xu ∈ E (G), which contradicts the assumption that
N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }. Hence y1 u ∈ E (G). Similarly we observe that y1 u′ ∈ E (G). Thus we have |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 2. Hence, (1)
assures us that |A| ≥ |A¯ |. On the other hand, by Claim 1, we know that |G| ≥ 10, which implies that |A| + |A¯ | = |G| − |S | ≥ 5.
This together with the fact |A| ≥ |A¯ | implies |A| ≥ 3, which contradicts the assumption that |A| = 2. This contradiction
proves (2).
Subclaim 3.3. y1 ̸∈ Ad(x; A).
Proof. Assume y1 is an admissible vertex of (x; A). Then N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A ̸= ∅ and |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2. Since |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2,
Subclaim 3.2(1) assures us that |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 2, N (y1 ) ∩ N (A) = {x} and |A| ≥ |A¯ |. Also Subclaim 3.2(2)
assures us that |A| ≥ 3. Now we know that |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3, |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 2, N (y1 ) ∩ N (A) = {x} and N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A ̸= ∅.
Applying Claim 2 with the role of y replaced by y1 , we see that there is an xy1 -fragment A′ such that |N (y1 ) ∩ A′ | = 1, which
contradicts the choice of A. This contradiction proves Subclaim 3.3.
We proceed with the proof of Claim 3. Subclaim 3.2(2) assures us |A| ≥ 3, hence now we know |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3 and
N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅. Applying Lemma 6, we see that there is an admissible vertex of (x; A). Since N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }, either
y1 or y2 is an admissible vertex of (x; A). By Subclaim 3.3, we know that y1 ̸∈ Ad(x; A). Hence y2 is an admissible vertex of
(x; A), which implies N (x) ∩ N (y2 ) ∩ A ̸= ∅. Let u ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y2 ) ∩ A. By Subclaim 3.1 we know that |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 2. Thus
we have |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3, |N (y2 ) ∩ A| = 2, N (y2 ) ∩ N (A) = {x} and u ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y) ∩ A. Applying Claim 2 with the role of y
replaced by y2 , we see that there is an xy2 -fragment A′ such that A′
A and N (y2 ) ∩ A′ = {u}. Since N (x) ∩ A′ ∩ V5 = ∅, we
observe that |A′ | ≥ 2. We show |A′ | ≥ 3. Assume |A′ | = 2, say A′ = {u, w}. Since N (y2 ) ∩ A′ = {u} and x ∈ N (A′ ), we see that
w ∈ V5 and xw ∈ E (G), which contradicts the assumption that N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }. Hence, it is shown that |A′ | ≥ 3. Since
|A¯ ′ | ≥ 2, |A′ | ≥ 3 and N (x) ∩ A′ ∩ V5 = ∅, applying Lemma 6 with the role of A replaced by A′ , we see that Ad(x; A′ ) ̸= ∅.
By Subclaim 3.3, we observe that y1 ̸∈ Ad(x; A), which implies y1 is not an admissible vertex of (x; A′ ) since A′
A. Since
|N (y2 ) ∩ A′ | = 1, y2 is not an admissible vertex of (x; A′ ). Hence, since neither y1 nor y2 is an admissible vertex of (x; A′ )
and N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }, we see that Ad(x; A′ ) = ∅, which contradicts the previous assertion. This contradiction proves
Claim 3.

By Claim 3, there is a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment. Let A be a minimal y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment and let S = N (A). Since A
is {y1 , y2 }-free, we observe that N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅ and |A| ≥ 2. Since y2 ∈ A¯ and y1 y2 ̸∈ E (G), we also see that |A¯ | ≥ 2.
Claim 4. |A¯ | ≥ 3.
Proof. Assume |A¯ | = 2, say A¯ = {y2 , z }. Then, Claim 1 assures us that |A| = |G| − |S | − |A¯ | ≥ 3. Let B be an xy2 -fragment
and let T = N (B). Since N (x) ∩ A¯ ∩ V5 = {y2 }, we observe S − {x} ⊂ N (z ), which implies that B is an (x, A¯ )-fit fragment.
¯ Assume x is not tractable with A.
¯ Then, we observe that either |S ∩ B| = 1 or |S ∩ B¯ | = 1.
We show x is tractable with A.
Without loss of generality, we may assume |S ∩ B| = 1, say S ∩ B = {w}. Since |S ∩ B| < |A¯ ∩ T |, Lemma 2(2) assures us
that A ∩ B = ∅, which implies B = S ∩ B = {w} and T = N (w). Hence w ∈ V5 and xw ∈ E (G), which implies w = y1 since
N (x) ∩ V5 = {y1 , y2 }. Then, since T = N (w) and y2 ∈ T , we see that y1 y2 ∈ E (G), which contradicts Proposition 1. This
contradiction proves |S ∩ B| ≥ 2. By symmetry, we have |S ∩ B¯ | ≥ 2 and |S ∩ B| = |S ∩ B¯ | = 2. It is shown that x is tractable
¯
with A.
¯ we observe that S ∩ T = {x}. Then, without loss of generality, we may assume that
Since x is tractable with A,
y1 ∈ S ∩ B. Since |A¯ ∩ T | = 2 and S ∩ T = {x}, we observe that |A ∩ T | = 2. Now we know that |A ∩ T | = 2 and
|(S ∩ B) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| = |(S ∩ B¯ ) ∪ (S ∩ T ) ∪ (A ∩ T )| = 5. Hence, since y1 ∈ S ∩ B, if A ∩ B ̸= ∅, then A ∩ B is
a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment, which contradicts the minimality of A. Thus A ∩ B = ∅, which implies that A ∩ B¯ ̸= ∅ since
¯ we see that v y1 ̸∈ E (G). Hence, since
|A| ≥ 3 and |A ∩ T | = 2. Let v ∈ N (x) ∩ (A ∩ B¯ ). Then, since y1 ∈ S ∩ B and v ∈ A ∩ B,
N (x) ∩ S ∩ V5 = {y1 } and v y1 ̸∈ E (G), we observe that Ad(x, v; A) = ∅. Since |A¯ | = 2, |A| ≥ 3 and Ad(x, v; A) = ∅, applying
Lemma 3 with the role y replaced by v , we see that there is a xv -fragment A′ such that A′
A. Then, since |A¯ ′ | ≥ 2, A′ ∩V5 ̸= ∅,
′
′
applying Lemma 6 with the role of A replaced by A , we see that Ad(x; A ) ̸= ∅, which implies that y1 is an admissible vertex
of (x; A′ ) since N (x) ∩ N (A′ ) ∩ V5 ⊂ {y1 }. Hence, we observe that A′ is a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment, which contradicts the
minimality of A since A′
A. This contradiction proves Claim 4.
Claim 5. N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A ̸= ∅ and |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2.
Proof. Since |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 2 and N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, applying Lemma 6, we see that there is an admissible vertex of (x; A).
Then, since N (x) ∩ S ∩ V5 = {y1 }, we see that y1 is an admissible vertex of (x; A) and |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2, which implies the
desired conclusion.
Claim 6. |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1.
Proof. Assume |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | ≥ 2. Then, by Claim 5, we see that |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 2, N (y1 ) ∩ S = {x} and
N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A ̸= ∅.
Subclaim 6.1. |A| = 2.
Proof. Assume |A| ≥ 3. Then, we know that |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3, |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 2, N (y1 ) ∩ S = {x} and N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A ̸= ∅.
Then, applying Claim 2 with the role of y replaced by y1 , we see that there is a fragment A′ with respect to xy1 such that
A′
A, which contradicts the minimality of A. This contradiction proves that |A| = 2.
Since N (x) ∩ A ∩ V5 = ∅, we know that A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅. Furthermore, since N (y1 ) ∩ S = {x} and x ∈ V≥6 , we observe that
Ad(y1 ; A) = ∅. Since |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| = 2, A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅ and Ad(y1 ; A) = ∅, applying Lemma 5(2) with the role of x replaced by
y1 , we see that N (y1 ) ∩ S = ∅, which contradicts the fact that N (y1 ) ∩ S = {x}. This contradiction proves Claim 6.
By Claim 6, we know that |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, say N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ = {z2 }. Since |A| ≥ 2, |A¯ | ≥ 3 and |N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, applying
¯ respectively, we see that Ad(y1 , A¯ ) ̸= ∅. Since |N (y1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2 and
Lemma 3 with the roles of x and A replaced by y1 and A,
|N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ | = 1, we have |N (y1 ) ∩ S | ≤ 2. This together with the fact that x ∈ V≥6 assures us that there is the only admissible
vertex of (y1 , A¯ ). Let z1 be the admissible vertex of (y1 , A¯ ). Then z1 ∈ V5 ∩ S ∩ N (y1 ), z1 z2 ∈ E (G) and |N (z1 ) ∩ A¯ | ≥ 2. If
|N (z1 ) ∩ A| = 1, say N (z1 ) ∩ A = {v}, then A − {v} is a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment, which contradicts the minimality of A.
Hence we see that |N (z1 ) ∩ A| ≥ 2. Since |N (z1 )| = 5, we know that |N (z1 ) ∩ A¯ | = |N (z1 ) ∩ A| = 2 and N (z1 ) ∩ S = {y1 }.
Let N (z1 ) ∩ A¯ = {z2 , u1 }.
Claim 7. z2 ∈ V5 and z2 u1 ∈ E (G).
Proof. Since N (y1 )∩A¯ = {z2 }, we observe that y1 u1 ̸∈ E (G). Hence, since N (z1 )∩S = {y1 }, we observe that Ad(z1 , u1 ; A¯ ) = ∅.
¯
Since |A| ≥ 2, |A¯ | ≥ 3 and Ad(z1 , u1 ; A¯ ) = ∅, applying Lemma 3 with the roles of x, y and A replaced by z1 , u1 and A,
¯ Then, since N (z1 ) ∩ A¯ = {u1 , z2 } and A′
respectively, we see that there is a z1 u1 -fragment A′ such that A′
A.
A¯ we
¯ we see that y1 ∈ N (A′ ) and N (y1 ) ∩ A′ = {z2 }.
observe that N (z1 ) ∩ A′ = {z2 }. Since y1 ̸∈ A, N (y1 ) ∩ A¯ = {z2 } and A′
A,
Hence we observe that N ({z1 , y1 }) ∩ A′ = {z2 }. Since N ({z1 , y1 }) ∩ A′ = {z2 }, applying Lemma 1 with the roles of S and
A replaced by {z1 , y1 } and A′ , respectively, we see that A′ = {z2 }, which implies z2 ∈ V5 and z2 u1 ∈ E (G) and Claim 7 is
proved.
By Claim 7, we know that {z1 , z2 } ⊂ N (y1 ) ∩ V5 . Now we know that N (y1 ) ∩ S = {x, z1 } and |N (y1 ) ∩ A| = 2. Let
N (y1 ) ∩ A = {z3 , z4 }. Since N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A ̸= ∅, without loss of generality, we may assume that z4 ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A.
To complete the proof of Proposition 2, we first consider the case that |A| = 2 and later we consider the case that |A| ≥ 3.

At first suppose |A| = 2. Let S = {x, y1 , z1 , w1 , w2 }. In this case, since |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| = 2 and A ∩ V≥6 ̸= ∅, applying
Lemma 5(3), we see that S − {x} = {y1 , z1 , w1 , w2 } ⊂ V5 . If xz3 ∈ E (G), then we see that {z3 , z4 } ⊂ V≥6 and a configuration
of the second kind arises. Otherwise, if xz3 ̸∈ E (G), then we see that {z1 , z2 , z3 } ⊂ N (y1 )∩V5 and {x, z4 } ⊂ N (y1 )∩(V (G)−V5 ).
Hence a degenerated configuration of the first kind arises.
The remaining case is |A| ≥ 3. Assume |A| ≥ 3. We show a configuration of the first kind arises in this case. Recall that
N (y1 ) ∩ A = {z3 , z4 } and z4 ∈ N (x) ∩ N (y1 ) ∩ A.
Claim 8. z1 z3 ∈ E (G).
Proof. Assume z1 z3 ̸∈ E (G). Then we observe that Ad(y1 , z3 ; A) = ∅ since N (y1 ∩ S ∩ V5 ) = {z1 }. Then, since |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3
and Ad(y1 , z3 ; A) = ∅, applying Lemma 3 with the roles of x and yreplaced by y1 and z3 , respectively, we see that there is
a y1 z3 -fragment A′ such that A′
A. Since N (y1 ) ∩ A = {z3 , z4 } and z3 ∈ N (A′ ), we observe that z4 ∈ A′ , which implies
x ∈ N (A′ ) since xz4 ∈ E (G). Hence we see that A′ is a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment, which contradicts the minimality of A. This
contradiction proves Claim 8.
By Claim 8, we have z3 ∈ N (z1 ) ∩ A. Let N (z1 ) ∩ A = {z3 , u2 }.
Claim 9. u2 ̸= z4 .
Proof. Assume that u2 = z4 . Then N ({y1 , z1 }) ∩ A = {z3 , z4 }. Since |A| ≥ 3, we observe that A′ = A − {z3 , z4 } ̸= ∅. Since
|N (A′ )| = |(S − {y1 , z1 }) ∪ {z3 , z4 }| = 5, A′ is an xz4 -fragment. Then, since |A¯ ′ | ≥ 2 and N (x) ∩ A′ ∩ V5 = ∅, applying
Lemma 6 with the role of A replaced by A′ , we see that Ad(x; A′ ) ̸= ∅. On the other hand, since A′ ∩ {y1 , y2 } = ∅, we see that
Ad(x; A′ ) = ∅, which contradicts the previous assertion. This contradiction proves Claim 9.
Claim 10. z3 ∈ N (u2 ) ∩ V5 .
Proof. Since u2 ̸= z4 , we observe that u2 y1 ̸∈ E (G), which implies that Ad(z1 , u2 ; A) = ∅ since N (z1 ) ∩ S = {y1 }. Then,
since |A¯ | ≥ 2, |A| ≥ 3 and Ad(z1 , u2 ; A) = ∅, applying Lemma 3 with the roles of x and y replaced by z1 and u2 , respectively,
we see that there is a z1 u2 -fragment A′ such that A′
A. Since N (z1 ) ∩ A = {z3 , u2 } and u2 ∈ N (A′ ), we observe that
N (z1 ) ∩ A′ = {z3 }, which implies y1 ∈ N (A′ ) since y1 z3 ∈ E (G). If x ∈ N (A′ ) then A′ is a y2 -opposite xy1 -fragment, which
contradicts the minimality of A. Hence x ̸∈ N (A′ ), which implies z4 ̸∈ A′ since xz4 ∈ E (G). Since N (y1 ) ∩ A = {z3 , z4 }, we see
that N (y1 ) ∩ A′ = {z3 }. Now we observe that N ({z1 , y1 }) ∩ A′ = {z3 }. Since N ({z1 , y1 }) ∩ A′ = {z3 }, applying Lemma 1 with
the roles of S and A replaced by {z1 , y1 } and A′ , respectively, we see that A′ = {z3 }. This implies z3 ∈ V5 and z3 u2 ∈ E (G).
Now Claim 10 is proved.
By Claims 8–10, we find a configuration of the first kind around (x, y1 ), and the proof of Proposition 2 is completed.
5. Proof of Main Theorem
In this section we give a proof of Main Theorem.
We use a discharging method to prove Main Theorem.
Let G be a contraction-critically 5-connected graph and let x ∈ V (G). We put ch0 (x) unit of charge on x before discharging
process according to the following rule.
ch0 (x) =

0,
1



if x ∈ V5
otherwise.

In discharging process we move ϕ(x, y) unit of charge from x to y by the following rule.

ϕ(x, y) =




1

|N (x) ∩ V5 |

0,

,

if xy ∈ EG (V (G) − V5 , V5 )
otherwise.

We denote ch(x) the amount of charge on x ∈ V (G) after discharging process.
∑
Then, since we put a unit of charge on each vertex of V (G) − V5 , we observe that |G| − |V5 | =
x∈V (G∑
) ch0 (x). Since
∑
the discharging process do not change the total amount of charge on V (G), we see that
ch

x∈V (G)
x∈V (G) ch(x).

rule,

y∈V (G) ch(y) ≤ |V5 |. Then |V (G) − V5 | =
x∈V (G) ch0 (x) =
x∈V (G) ch(x) ≤ |V5 |, which implies that |V5 | ≥ 2 |G|. Thus, it
is enough to show that ch(y) ≤ 1 for each y ∈ V5 .
Let X = {x ∈ V (G) | deg(x) ≥ 6 and |N (x) ∩ V5 | = 2 }. We divide V5 into two sets W and W ′ as follows.
W = {y ∈ V5 | N (y) ∩ X = ∅} and W ′ = V5 − W . Let y ∈ V5 . Let N˜ (y) = N (y) ∩ (V (G) − V5 ). Then, by Theorem E,
we know that |N (y) ∩ V5 | ≥ 2, which implies that |N˜ (y)| ≤ 3. At first assume y ∈ W . Then, from each vertex of N˜ (y), y
receives at most 31 unit of charge through the discharging process. Hence ch(y) ≤ 13 × |N˜ (y)| ≤ 1 since |N˜ (y)| ≤ 3.
Next assume y ∈ W ′ and let x ∈ N (y) ∩ X . Then, Proposition 2 assures us that there is either a configuration of the first
kind or a configuration of the second kind around (x, y). If there is a configuration of the first kind, then we observe that

|N˜ (y)| = 2. Hence ch(y) ≤ 12 × |N˜ (y)| ≤ 1. So assume there is a configuration of the second kind around (x, y). In this case
|N˜ (y)| = 3. Let N˜ (y) = {x, z3 , z4 } as in Proposition 2. Then we see that |N (z3 ) ∩ V5 | = |N (z4 ) ∩ V5 | = 4, which implies that
ϕ(z3 , y) = ϕ(z4 , y) = 41 . Hence, ch(y) = ϕ(x, y) + ϕ(z3 , y) + ϕ(z4 , y) = 12 + 14 + 14 = 1. Now it is shown that ch(y) ≤ 1
for each y ∈ V5 and the proof of Main Theorem is completed.

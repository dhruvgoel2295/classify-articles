Let P be a set of n points in general position in the plane. In 1996, Urabe considered a
partition of P into subsets S 1 ∪ · · · ∪ S l such that each S i forms a hole (or an empty convex
polygon) of P and these holes are mutually disjoint. Let f ( P ) be the minimum number of
holes over all such partitions of P and F (n) = max{ f ( P )} over all sets P of n points. Then

1. Introduction
Partitioning point sets into convex subsets is a ubiquitous problem in discrete geometry. In the 1935 landmark paper of
˝ and Szekeres [5], they proved that for any integer k ≥ 3 there exists a smallest positive integer N (k) such that any set
Erdos
of at least N (k) points, in general position in the plane, contains the vertex set of a convex k-gon. Moreover, they proved
the following result.
˝

Theorem. (See [5,6].)

2k−2 + 1 ≤ N (k) ≤

2k − 4

+ 1.

Although the lower bound is conjectured to be tight, E. Klein showed N (4) = 5 while E. Makai proved N (5) = 9, as
noted in [5]; however, the ﬁrst published proof of N (5) = 9 did not appear until 1970 [12]. Szekeres and Peters [17] proved
N (6) = 17 in 2006. Slight improvements on the upper bound were obtained, ﬁrst by Chung and Graham [2], then by Kleit2k−5
man and Pachter [13], and subsequently by Tóth and Valtr [18,19]. The current best upper bound is N (k) ≤ k−2 + 1 [19].
˝ [4] asked a similar question for the value of the smallest integer N 0 (k) with k ≥ 3 such that any set of
In 1978, Erdos
N 0 (k) points, in general position in the plane, contains the vertex set of a convex k-gon whose interior is disjoint from the
point set. Such a convex k-gon is called an empty convex k-gon or a k-hole of the point set. Klein showed N 0 (4) = 5 in [5]
and N 0 (5) = 10 was determined by Harborth [9]. Horton [10] gave a construction showing that N 0 (7) is not ﬁnite, that is,
there are arbitrarily many points with no empty convex 7-gons.
As for the lower bound of the remaining case k = 6, Avis and Rappaport [1] have found a set of 20 points containing
no empty convex hexagon. Fabella and O’Rourke [7] found a similar set of 22 points. Overmars, Scholten and Vincent [16]

also constructed a set of 26 points without an empty convex 6-gon. In 2003, Overmars [15] exhibited a set of 29 points,
the largest known, with no empty convex 6-gons. For a long time, the question of the existence of empty convex hexagons
remained open. However, N 0 (6) was shown to be ﬁnite by Nicolás [14] in 2007, and Gerken [8] in 2008. Gerken proved that
any point set containing a convex 9-gon also contains an empty convex 6-gon; hence, by the best upper bound for N (9)
mentioned above, it follows that N 0 (6) ≤ 1717. The current best bounds for N 0 (6) are given by the inequality 30 ≤ N 0 (6) ≤
1717.
On the other hand, Urabe [20] was interested in the minimum number of mutually disjoint holes in a planar point
set and deﬁned a function F (n) in 1996 as follows. Let P be a set of n points in general position in the plane. For a
subset Q ⊆ P , denote the convex hull of Q by conv( Q ). A disjoint convex partition of P is a partition of P into subsets
S 1 , . . . , S l ; P = 1≤i ≤l S i , such that S i forms an | S i |-hole of P for each i , 1 ≤ i ≤ l, and these holes are mutually disjoint;
conv( S i ) ∩ conv( S j ) = ∅ for any pair {i , j }, 1 ≤ i , j ≤ l. Here, we allow a k-hole of P for k = 1, 2; that is, a 1-hole is a point
in P and a 2-hole is the line segment between two points in P . Let f ( P ) denote the minimum number of holes over all
disjoint convex partitions of P . Deﬁne F (n) = max{ f ( P )}, over all sets P of n points.
In addition, Urabe also considered a weaker notion of an empty convex partition of P , which is a partition of P into
subsets S 1 ∪ · · · ∪ S l such that each S i forms an | S i |-hole of P (that is, only the ﬁrst condition of a disjoint convex partition
is required). Then functions similar to f ( P ) and F (n) can be deﬁned; denote these functions by g ( P ) and G (n), respectively.
Note that G (n) ≤ F (n) trivially holds for any n. He proved the following results in [20], with the lower bound for F (n)
obtained from that of G (n).

9
the lower bound is improved to

n for any n and to
inﬁnitely many n [3]. Thus, the current best bounds of both functions are given by the following result.

In this paper, we further improve the upper bound for F (n) and prove the following theorem. It means that we can
always partition any set of n points into at most n4 + 1 subsets so that each subset forms a hole of the set and these holes
are mutually disjoint.

Finally, we note that it has been shown that G (11) < F (11) [20].
2. Preliminaries
We provide the basic deﬁnitions we use in the proof and introduce some notations. Let P be a given ﬁnite planar point
set in general position. For a closed region R in the plane, a point of P in the interior of R is called an interior point of R. If
R contains no interior points, then R is said to be empty.
Let a, b and c be three non-collinear points in the plane which are not necessarily elements of P . We denote by γ (a; b, c )
or γ (a; c , b) the closed convex cone with apex a and b and c on the boundary. If γ (a; b, c ) is not empty, we deﬁne an attack
point from the half-line ab to ac, denoted by α (a; b, c ), as the unique interior point of γ (a; b, c ) for which γ (a; b, α (a; b, c ))

is empty. If δ = b or c, let δ be a (dummy) point collinear with a and δ so that a lies on the line segment δδ . Then we
can consider another convex cone γ (a; b , c ). We give examples of two attack points in Fig. 1(a) where P is the set of black
points.
We next deﬁne the quasi-attack point α (a; b, c ) in γ (a; b, c ) to be the point c if γ (a; b, c ) is empty, or the attack point
α (a; b, c ), otherwise. We also consider the attack point outside a speciﬁed subset S ⊂ P ; denoted by α S¯ = α S¯ (a; b, c ), it is
the interior point of γ (a; b, c ) such that α S¯ ∈ P \ S and all the interior points of γ (a; b, α S¯ ) are contained in S. See Fig. 1(b),
where S is the set of white points and P \ S is the set of black points.
Finally, we denote the closed half-plane bounded by the line ab and containing c by H (ab; c ). For a subset Q of P ,
we denote the set of vertices of conv( Q ) by V ( Q ) = { v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v l }, where the elements are labeled in clockwise order.
We remark that when indexing a set of t points, we identify indices modulo t. If a point set S forms a k-hole H and
S = { p 1 , p 2 , . . . , pk } with the elements labeled in clockwise order, we write H = ( p 1 p 2 · · · pk )k .
3. Proof of Theorem
Before presenting the proof of Theorem, we brieﬂy review the proof from [20] yielding F (n) ≤ 2n
.

1. Let P be a set of n points in general position in the plane. Consider a line L not parallel to any of the 2 lines
determined by P . Translate L in a direction normal to itself. Then L can only meet exactly one point in P . Thus, we
have disjoint n7 strips parallel to L such that each of the n7 strips contains exactly seven points in P and the possibly
remaining strip contains at most six points in P .
2. It was proven that any 7-point set can be partitioned into two subsets such that one forms a 3-hole and the other
forms a 4-hole and they are disjoint, that is, F (7) ≤ 2. Trivially, F (r ) ≤ 1 for r = 1, 2, 3 and F (r ) ≤ 2 for r = 4, 5, 6. We
enumerate the number of holes on each strip. Let n = 7k + r for 0 ≤ r ≤ 6. Since a parallel strip is convex, the following
holds: F (n) ≤ kF (7) + F (r ) ≤ 2n
.
7
We remark that in this proof each 7-point set separated from P lies in a convex region. As for our proof, such a region
may be concave. We propose the following separation method.
Admissible Separation:
Let P be a ﬁnite set of points in general position in the plane. Consider a subset P k ⊆ P such that conv( P k ) ∩ P = P k .
The subset P k has an admissible separation if we can ﬁnd a subset S k
P k satisfying the following two properties (P-1) and
(P-2):
(P-1) Let P k+1 = P k \ S k . P k+1 is contained in a closed convex region R k+1 whose interior is disjoint from S k .
(P-2) | S k | = 4m with m = 1, 2, 3. S k can be partitioned into m subsets such that each subset forms a hole of the set and
these m holes are mutually disjoint. The m disjoint holes lie in the closure of conv( P k ) \ R k+1 , and they belong to one
of the following ﬁve types:
(Type 1) one 4-hole
(Type 2) one 3-hole and one 5-hole
(Type 3) two 4-holes
(Type 4) one 3-hole, one 4-hole and one 5-hole
(Type 5) two 3-holes and one 6-hole.
Fig. 2 illustrates an admissible separation of (Type 2). The shaded closed convex region R k+1 contains the set P k+1 of
black points. The set S k of eight white points forms a 3-hole and a 5-hole with disjoint convex hull in the closure of
conv( P k ) \ R k+1 .

We present the following lemma whose proof is given in the next section.
Lemma. For a ﬁnite set P of points in general position in the plane, let P k be any subset of P such that conv( P k ) ∩ P = P k . Then, if
| P k | ≥ 13, P k has an admissible separation.
We continue to separate such a 4m-point set S k in (P-2), one by one, from a given point set P so that the remaining
point set P k+1 lies in the closed convex region R k+1 . We now prove our theorem.
Theorem. For any n ≥ 1,

Proof. Let P be a set of n points in general position in the plane. We can assume without loss of generality that | P | ≥ 13,
5n
since F (n) ≤ 18
≤ n4 + 1 for 1 ≤ n ≤ 12 by Result B. We apply Lemma to each step of our procedure. In the ﬁrst
step, let P 1 = P . Since | P 1 | ≥ 13 and conv( P 1 ) ∩ P = P 1 , then P 1 has an admissible separation. In any kth step for k ≥ 2,
conv( P k ) ∩ P = P k holds since P k is contained in a closed convex region R k whose interior is disjoint from S k−1 . Thus,
P k has an admissible separation (if | P k | ≥ 13). We recursively obtain an inclusion relation P = P 1
P 2 · · · P L −1
PL
where | P L −1 | ≥ 13 and 1 ≤ | P L | ≤ 12.
By S k = P k \ P k+1 , P = S 1 ∪ · · · ∪ S L −1 ∪ P L . Since every S k forms mutually disjoint holes of some type in (P-2) in the
closure of conv( P k ) \ R k+1 , then all the holes of the S k ’s are mutually disjoint. In (Type 1), a 4-point set S k forms one hole.
In (Type 2) or (Type 3), an 8-point set S k forms two disjoint holes. And in (Type 4) or (Type 5), a 12-point set S k forms
three mutually disjoint holes. Thus, the set S 1 ∪ · · · ∪ S L −1 forms exactly 14 (| S 1 | + · · · + | S L −1 |) mutually disjoint holes in the
closure of conv( P ) \ R L . Let n = 4q + r with r = 0, 1, 2, 3. Since | P L | = 4q + r with q < q and | P L | ≤ 12, the following holds:

4. Proof of Lemma
We make three assumptions to prove Lemma. Each assumption narrows down the conﬁguration of P k . The proof is
divided into four parts, namely (I) to (IV).
Lemma. For a ﬁnite set P of points in general position in the plane, let P k be any subset of P such that conv( P k ) ∩ P = P k . Then, if
| P k | ≥ 13, P k has an admissible separation.
Proof. Let P k be as speciﬁed above. We construct m mutually disjoint holes of P k by a 4m-point set S k in (P-2) and ﬁnd a
closed convex region R k+1 so that R k+1 contains P k \ S k such that the m holes lie in the closure of conv( P k ) \ R k+1 . Denote
the set of these m holes by H and let R = R k+1 for simplicity.
(I) Let V ( P k ) = { v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v l } with the elements labeled in clockwise order. We ﬁrst consider any triangle v i v i +1 v i +2 of P k ,
say v 1 v 2 v 3 .
If v 1 v 2 v 3 is empty, then since | V ( P k )| ≥ 4 by | P k | ≥ 13, there is an attack point α1 = α ( v 1 ; v 3 , v l ). Then we are done
since we can construct a 4-hole H = {( v 1 v 2 v 3 α1 )4 } of (Type 1) and ﬁnd a closed convex region R = H ( v 1 α1 ; v l ). Otherwise,

since v 1 v 2 v 3 is not empty, there is p 1 = α ( v 1 ; v 2 , v 3 ). We have cases (A) and (B) depending on whether the convex cone
γ ( p 1 ; v 1 , v 2 ) is empty or not.
(A) γ ( p 1 ; v 1 , v 2 ) is not empty: We obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 α2 )4 } and R = γ ( p 1 ; α2 , v 1 ) for α2 = α ( p 1 ; v 1 , v 2 ) as shown in
Fig. 3, where the shaded portion contains the remaining interior points.
(B) γ ( p 1 ; v 1 , v 2 ) is empty: If
v 2 v 3 p 1 is empty, we obtain H = {( p 1 v 2 v 3 α3 )4 } and R = γ ( p 1 ; v 1 , α3 ) for α3 =
α ( p 1 ; v 3 , v 2 ). Otherwise, v 2 v 3 p 1 is not empty and let p 2 = α ( v 3 ; v 2 , p 1 ). Then if γ ( p 2 ; v 3 , v 2 ) is not empty, we obtain
H = {( p 2 v 2 v 3 α4 )}4 and R = γ ( p 2 ; α4 , v 3 ) for α4 = α ( p 2 ; v 3 , v 2 ). Thus, γ ( p 2 ; v 3 , v 2 ) is also empty.
We now obtain p 1 and p 2 as shown in Fig. 4 where the shaded portion contains the remaining interior points. Similarly,
we must consider, for any i, an element p i of P k associated with the edge v i v i +1 such that γ ( v i ; p i , v i +1 ) ∪ γ ( v i +1 ; p i , v i )
is empty and p i lies in p i −1 v i v i +1 ∩ v i v i +1 p i +1 . The point p i is called a friend of the edge v i v i +1 , and we now make
the ﬁrst assumption for conﬁgurations of P k without loss of generality.
Assumption 1. There exists a unique friend p i of the edge v i v i +1 for each i , 1 ≤ i ≤ l.
(II) We now argue using Assumption 1 and consider any triangle v i v i +1 v i +2 , say v 1 v 2 v 3 again. We consider cases (A) and
(B) depending on whether p 1 v 2 p 2 is empty or not.
(A) p 1 v 2 p 2 is not empty: Let a1 = α ( p 1 ; v 1 , p 2 ). If v 1 p 1 a1 is not empty, we obtain H = {( p 1 v 2 a1 α1 )4 } and R =
γ (a1 ; α1 , p 1 ) for α1 = α (a1 ; p 1 , v 1 ) as shown in Fig. 5. Otherwise, v 1 p 1a1 is empty. Then if γ (a1 ; v 1 , v 2 ) is also empty,
we obtain H = {( v 1 p 1 a1 α2 )4 } and R = γ (a1 ; v 2 , α2 ) for α2 = α (a1 ; v 2 , p 1 ).
If γ (a1 ; v 1 , v 2 ) is not empty, we let a2 = α (a1 ; v 1 , v 2 ). Consider subcases (1), (2) and (3) according to the position of a2 ,
where γ (a1 ; a2 , v 2 ) contains only the interior points { v 1 , p 1 }.
(1) a2 lies in H ( v 1 v 3 ; v 4 ): In this subcase, | V ( P k )| ≥ 4. For S = { p 2 , v 3 }, consider α S¯ = α S¯ (a2 ; a1 , v 1 ). If α S¯ exists,
we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , (a2 v 1 p 1 a1 α S¯ )5 } of (Type 2) and R = γ (a2 ; a1 , α S¯ ) ∩ H ( v 2 p 2 ; v 1 ) as shown in Fig. 6. Otherwise,
γ (a2 ; a1 , v 1 ) contains only the interior points { p 2 , v 3 }. Then we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , (a2 a1 p 2 v 3 α )5 } for α = α (a2 ; v 1 , a1 )
with R = γ (a2 ; a1 , α ).
(2) a2 lies in γ ( v 1 ; a1 , p 2 ): If γ ( v 1 ; a1 , a2 ) is empty, we obtain H = {( p 1 v 2 a1 a2 )4 } and R = H ( v 1 a2 ; v 3 ). If it is not
empty, we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , (a2 v 1 p 1 a1 α )5 } and R = γ (a2 ; a1 , α ) ∩ H ( v 2 p 2 ; v 1 ) for α = α (a2 ; a1 , v 1 ).
(3) a2 lies in γ ( v 1 ; p 2 , v 3 ): If there exists α S¯ = α S¯ (a2 ; a1 , v 1 ) for S = { p 2 }, we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , (a2 v 1 p 1 a1 α S¯ )5 }
and R = γ (a2 ; a1 , α S¯ ) ∩ H ( v 2 p 2 ; v 1 ). Thus, γ ( v 1 ; a1 , a2 ) contains only the interior point p 2 . Then if a1 p 2 v 3 is not empty,
we obtain H = {(a1 v 2 p 2 α1 )4 } and R = γ (a1 ; p 1 , α1 ) for α1 = α (a1 ; p 2 , v 3 ). Thus, a1 p 2 v 3 is empty.

Subsequently, if γ (a1 ; v 3 , v 2 ) is empty, we obtain H = {(a1 p 2 v 3 α2 )4 } and R = γ (a1 ; v 2 , α2 ) for α2 = α (a1 ; v 2 , a2 ). If it
is not empty, we let a3 = α (a1 ; v 3 , v 2 ). We can consider a3 to lie in γ ( v 3 ; p 1 , v 1 ) by the same argument as in (1) and (2);
so γ ( v 3 ; a1 , a3 ) contains only the interior point p 1 . (See Fig. 7.) Then we consider cases (a) and (b).

Fig. 9. The conﬁguration for | V ( P k )| = 4.

(a) γ (a2 ; v 1 , a3 ) is not empty: Let a4 = α (a2 ; v 1 , a3 ). If a4 lies in H ( v 2 a1 ; v 1 ), we obtain H = {( p 2 v 3 a3 )3 , ( p 1 v 2 a1 a4 a2 )5 }
and R = γ (a2 ; v 1 , a4 ) ∩ H (a3 v 3 ; v 1 ). If a4 lies in H ( v 2 a1 ; v 3 ) as shown in Fig. 7, we consider a quasi-attack point
α = α (a4 ; a2 , a3 ). Then we can construct a 5-hole H 5 = (a4a1 v 2 p 2 α )5 . Thus, we obtain H = {( v 1 p 1a2 )3 , H 5 } and R =
γ (a2 ; a1 , a4 ) ∩ H (a4 α ; v 3 ).
(b) γ (a2 ; v 1 , a3 ) is empty: If γ (a2 ; a1 , p 1 ) is not empty, we obtain H = {( v 2 p 2 a3 a1 )4 , ( v 1 p 1 a2 α3 )4 } of (Type 3) and
R = γ (a2 ; α3 , a3 ) for α3 = α (a2 ; a1 , p 1 ). See Fig. 8. Thus γ (a2 ; a1 , p 1 ) is empty, and γ (a3 ; a1 , p 2 ) is also empty by the same
reasoning. Then for α S¯ = α S¯ (a2 ; a3 , p 1 ) with S = { v 3 }, we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , (a2 p 1 a1 a3 α S¯ )5 } and R = γ (a2 ; v 1 , α S¯ ) ∩
H ( p 2 a3 ; v 2 ).
We have therefore shown that under case (A), P k has an admissible separation.
p 1 v 2 p 2 is empty: If
v 1 p 1 p 2 is not empty, we obtain H = {( p 1 v 2 p 2 α1 )4 } and R = γ ( p 2 ; α1 , v 3 ) for α1 =
(B)
α ( p 2 ; p 1 , v 1 ). Otherwise, v 1 p 1 p 2 is empty. Then if v 1 p 2 v 3 is not empty, we obtain H = {( p 1 v 2 p 2 α2 )4 } and R =
H ( v 1 α2 ; v 3 ) for α2 = α ( v 1 ; p 2 , v 3 ). Thus, v 1 p 2 v 3 is also empty.
If | V ( P k )| = 3, P k has an admissible separation by the existence of α2 in (B), and so we are done. Since both p i v i +1 p i +1
and the convex quadrilateral v i p i p i +1 v i +2 are empty for any i, we have | P k | = 8 < 13 if | V ( P k )| = 4, which has been
resolved. See Fig. 9. We may now make the second assumption for our conﬁgurations without loss of generality.
Assumption 2. | V ( P k )| ≥ 5. For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ l,
v i v i +1 and v i +1 v i +2 , respectively.

v i v i +1 v i +2 contains only two interior points of p i and p i +1 , friends of

Fig. 10 shows an illustration of Assumption 2 for | V ( P k )| = 5 where the shaded portion contains the remaining interior
points.
(III) We proceed to argue using Assumption 2. Take any pentagon v i −2 v i −1 v i v i +1 v i +2 of P k , say v l v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 ; then consider
cases (A) and (B) where γ ( v 1 ; v 3 , p 3 ) is empty or not.
(A) γ ( v 1 ; v 3 , p 3 ) is not empty: Let p = α ( v 1 ; v 3 , p 3 ). We have subcases (1) and (2).
(1) γ ( v 1 ; p , p 3 ) is not empty: Let a1 = α ( v 1 ; p , p 3 ). We have cases (a), (b) and (c) according to the position of a1 .
(a) a1 lies in H ( p 2 p ; v 2 ): We obtain H = {( v 3 v 4 p 3 )3 , ( p 1 v 2 p 2 pa1 )5 } and R = H ( v 1 a1 ; v 4 ) ∩ H ( v 2 v 4 ; v 1 ).
(b) a1 lies in γ ( p ; p 2 , p 3 ): We obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , (a1 pp 2 v 3 α1 )5 } and R = γ (a1 ; v 1 , α1 ) for α1 = α (a1 ; v 1 , p 3 ).
(c) a1 lies in H ( pp 3 ; v 3 ): If p 1 lies in H (a1 p ; v 2 ), we obtain H = {( v 3 v 4 p 3 )3 , ( p 1 v 2 p 2 a1 p )5 } and R = H ( v 1 a1 ; v 4 ) ∩
H ( v 2 v 4 ; v 1 ). If p 1 lies in H (a1 p ; v 1 ), we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , ( v 1 p 1 pa1 α2 )5 } and R = γ (a1 ; α2 , v 1 ) for α2 =
α (a1 ; v 1 , pl ). See Fig. 11.
(2) γ ( v 1 ; p , p 3 ) is empty: γ ( v 1 ; v 3 , p 3 ) contains only the interior point p. We consider the case where γ ( v 1 ; p 3 , v 4 ) is
not empty and let a2 = α ( v 1 ; p 3 , v 4 ). If a2 lies in H ( p 2 p ; v 2 ) as shown in Fig. 12, we obtain H = {( v 3 v 4 p 3 )3 , ( p 1 v 2 p 2 pa2 )5 }

Fig. 11. a1 lies in H ( pp 3 ; v 3 ).

Fig. 12. a2 lies in H ( p 2 p ; v 2 ).

and R = H ( v 1 a2 ; v 4 ) ∩ H ( v 2 v 4 ; v 1 ). If a2 lies in H ( p 2 p ; v 3 ), we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( pp 2 v 3 p 3 a2 )5 } and R =
H ( v 1 a2 ; v 4 ). Thus, γ ( v 1 ; p 3 , v 4 ) is empty.
(B) γ ( v 1 ; v 3 , p 3 ) is empty: If γ ( v 1 ; p 3 , v 4 ) is also empty, we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , ( v 1 p 1 p 3 v 4 α )5 } and R = H (α v 4 ; v l )
for α = α ( v 4 ; v 1 , pl ). Otherwise, γ ( v 1 ; p 3 , v 4 ) is not empty and let p = α ( v 1 ; p 3 , v 4 ).
We now consider the case where γ ( v 1 ; p , v 4 ) is not empty and let a1 = α ( v 1 ; p , v 4 ). Then if a1 lies in H ( p 2 p ; v 2 ), we
obtain H = {( v 3 v 4 p 3 )3 , ( p 1 v 2 p 2 pa1 )5 } and R = H ( v 1 a1 ; v 4 ) ∩ H ( v 2 v 4 ; v 1 ), and if a1 lies in H ( p 2 p ; v 3 ), we obtain H =
{( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( pp 2 v 3 p 3 a1 )5 } and R = H ( v 1 a1 ; v 4 ). Thus, γ ( v 1 ; p 3 , v 4 ) contains only the interior point p since γ ( v 1 ; p , v 4 )
is empty.
Since the convex quadrilateral v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 only contains the interior points { p , p 1 , p 2 , p 3 } by cases (A) and (B), | V ( P k )| = 5
implies that | P k | = 11 < 13 which has been resolved. See Fig. 13. Denote the convex quadrilateral v i −1 v i v i +1 v i +2 of P k by
Q i for any i. We may now make the ﬁnal assumption without loss of generality.
Assumption 3. | V ( P k )| ≥ 6. For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ l, Q i contains only the interior point p i in Q i \
besides the friends { p i −1 , p i , p i +1 }.

i −2≤ j ≤i +1

v j v j +1 v j +2

We call this interior point p i a navel of Q i . Fig. 14 gives an illustration of Assumption 3 where Q 2 and Q 3 have no
common navel but Q 1 and Q 2 have the common navel; here the shaded portion contains the remaining interior points.

Fig. 15. p 1 lies in H ( pa1 ; v 2 ).

(IV) We proceed to argue using Assumption 3. Take any two consecutive quadrilaterals Q i and Q i +1 of P k , say Q 1 and Q 2 ;
we then consider cases (A) and (B).
(A) Q 1 and Q 2 have the common navel: Denote the common navel by p = p 1 = p 2 , where p lies in γ ( v l ; v 2 , v 3 ) ∩
γ ( v 4 ; v 2 , v 1 ) ∩ H ( v 1 v 3 ; v 4 ). We have subcases (1) and (2).
(1) γ ( v l ; v 3 , p 3 ) is not empty: Let a1 = α ( v l ; v 3 , p 3 ).
(a) a1 lies in H ( v 2 p ; v 1 ): We obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , ( pl v 1 p 1 pa1 )5 } and R = H ( v l a1 ; v 4 ).
(b) a1 lies in H ( v 2 p ; v 3 ): If p 1 lies in H ( pa1 ; v 1 ), we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , ( pl v 1 p 1 pa1 )5 } and R = H ( v l a1 ; v 4 ). If
p 1 lies in H ( pa1 ; v 2 ) as shown in Fig. 15, then for α = α ( p ; v 4 , a1 ) we obtain H = {( p 2 v 3 p 3 )3 , ( pp 1 v 2 v 4 α )5 } and R =
γ ( p ; v 1 , α ).
(2) γ ( v l ; v 3 , p 3 ) is empty: For the same reason as in (1), γ ( v 4 ; v 1 , pl ) is also empty. Since we have at least three
interior points of γ ( p ; v l , v 4 ) by | P k | ≥ 13 or | V ( P k )| ≥ 6, we suppose that γ ( p ; v l , v 2 ) contains at least two interior points
by symmetry. Let a1 = α ( p ; v l , v 2 ).
(a) p 2 lies in H ( pa1 ; v 2 ): We obtain H = {( v 1 pl v l )3 , ( p 1 v 2 p 2 pa1 )5 } and R = γ ( p ; a1 , v 3 ).
(b) p 2 lies in H ( pa1 ; v 3 ): Consider a2 = α ( p ; a1 , v 2 ). If a2 lies in H ( p 1 a1 ; v 2 ), we obtain H = {( v 1 pl v l )3 , ( p 1 v 2 pa2 a1 )5 }
and R = γ ( p ; a2 , a1 ). If a2 lies in H ( p 1 a1 ; v 1 ) as shown in Fig. 16, then since there is α S¯ = α S¯ ( p 3 ; v l , v 3 ) for S = {a1 , a2 },
we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( v l pl a1 a2 )4 , ( pp 2 v 3 p 3 α S¯ )5 } of (Type 4) and R = H ( pa2 ; v 3 ) ∩ H (α S¯ p 3 ; v 4 ).

Fig. 17. pl lies in H ( pa1 ; v l ).

(B) Q 1 and Q 2 have no common navel: Denote the navels of Q 1 and Q 2 by p = p 1 and q = p 2 , where p lies in
γ ( v l ; v 2 , v 3 ) ∩ H ( v 1 v 4 ; v l ), and q lies in γ ( v 4 ; v 2 , v 1 ) ∩ H ( v l v 3 , v 4 ). We remark that if we consider a1 = α ( v l ; v 3 , v 4 ), then
a1 = q, p 3 or another interior point. We have subcases (1), (2) and (3).
(1) a1 = q, p 3 :
(a) a1 lies in H ( p 1 p ; v 1 ): We obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , ( v 1 p 1 pa1 pl )5 } and R = H ( v l a1 ; v 4 ).
(b) a1 lies in H ( p 1 p ; v 2 ): (The line pa1 may intersect the side v 1 v 2 .)
(i) pl lies in H ( pa1 ; v l ): If γ (a1 ; v l , v 3 ) is not empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( p 2 v 3 p 3 q)4 , ( v l pl pa1 α )5 } and R =
γ (a1 ; α , v l ) ∩ H ( v 1 v 4 ; v l ) for α = α (a1 ; v l , v 3 ). See Fig. 17. If it is empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 pl v l )3 , (a1 pp 1 v 2 p 2 )5 } and
R = H (a1 v 3 ; v 4 ).
(ii) pl does not lie in H ( pa1 ; v l ): (The line pa1 intersects the side v l v 1 and pl lies in H ( pa1 ; v 1 ).) We obtain H =
{( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , ( v 1 p 1 a1 ppl )5 } and R = H ( v l a1 ; v 4 ).
(2) a1 = p 3 : If pl lies in H ( pp 3 ; v 1 ), we obtain H = {( p 1 v 2 p 2 )3 , ( v 1 v 3 p 3 ppl )5 } and R = H ( v l p 3 ; v 4 ). If pl lies in
H ( pp 3 ; v l ) as shown in Fig. 18, we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , ( pv 1 p 1 p 3 α )5 } and R = γ ( p ; p 3 , α ) for α = α ( p ; p 3 , q).
(3) a1 = q: α ( v 4 ; v 1 , v l ) = p for the same reason as in (1) and (2). If pl lies in H ( pq; v 1 ), we obtain H =
{( p 1 v 2 p 2 )3 , (qppl v 1 v 3 )5 } and R = H ( v l q; v 4 ). Thus, pl lies in H ( pq; v l ), and p 3 also lies in H ( pq; v 4 ) by the same way.
(a) γ ( v l ; q, p 3 ) is not empty: Let a2 = α ( v l ; q, p 3 ).
(i) a2 lies in H ( p 1 p ; v 1 ): If γ (a2 ; v l , p ) is not empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , (qp 2 v 3 p 3 )4 , ( v l pl pa2 α1 )5 } and R =
γ (a2 ; α1 , v l ) ∩ H ( pv 4 ; v l ) for α1 = α (a2 ; v l , p ). If it is empty, there is α2 = α (q; v 4 , a2 ) by | V ( P k )| ≥ 6 as shown in Fig. 19.
We then obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , (qp 3 v 4 α2 )4 , ( v 1 p 1 pa2 pl )5 } and R = H ( v l a2 ; v 4 ) ∩ H (qα2 ; v l ).
(ii) a2 lies in H ( p 2 q; v 3 ): If γ (a2 ; v l , q ) is not empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , (qp 2 v 3 p 3 )4 , ( v l pl pa2 α3 )5 } and R =
γ (a2 ; α3 , v l ) ∩ H ( pv 4 ; v l ) for α3 = α (a2 ; v l , q ). See Fig. 20. If it is empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( v l pl pqa2 )5 } and
R = γ (q; a2 , p 2 ).
(iii) a2 lies in H ( p 1 p ; v 2 ) ∩ H ( p 2 q; v 2 ): We obtain H = {( v l v 1 pl )3 , ( v 3 v 4 p 3 )3 , ( pp 1 v 2 p 2 qa2 )6 } of (Type 5) and R =
H ( v l a2 ; v 4 ) ∩ H ( pv 4 ; v l ).
(b) γ ( v l ; q, p 3 ) is empty: γ ( v 4 ; p , pl ) is also empty for the same reason as in (a). To show that γ ( v l ; p 3 , v 4 ) is empty,
we also consider a3 = α ( v l ; p 3 , v 4 ). We follow a similar argument to in (a).

(i) a3 lies in H ( p 1 p ; v 1 ): If γ (a3 ; v l , p ) is not empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( p 2 v 3 p 3 q)4 , ( v l pl pa3 α4 )5 } and
R = γ (a3 ; α4 , v l ) for α4 = α (a3 ; v l , p ). If it is empty, we obtain H = {( v 2 v 3 p 2 )3 , (qp 3 v 4 α5 )4 , ( pl v 1 p 1 pa3 )5 } and R =
H ( v l a3 ; v 4 ) ∩ H (qα5 ; v l ) for α5 = α (q; v 4 , a3 ). See Fig. 21.
(ii) a3 lies in H ( p 2 q; v 3 ): If γ (a3 ; v l , q ) is not empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( p 2 v 3 p 3 q)4 , ( v l pl pa3 α6 )5 } and R =
γ (a3 ; α6 , v l ) for α6 = α (a3 ; v l , q ). See Fig. 22. If it is empty, we obtain H = {( v 1 v 2 p 1 )3 , ( v l pl pqa3 )5 } and R = γ (q; a3 , p 2 ).
(iii) a3 lies in H ( p 1 p ; v 2 ) ∩ H ( p 2 q; v 2 ): We obtain H = {( v l v 1 pl )3 , ( v 3 v 4 p 3 )3 , ( pp 1 v 2 p 2 qa3 )6 } and R = H ( v l a3 ; v 4 ) ∩
H ( p l v 4 ; v l ).
Since γ ( v l ; p 3 , v 4 ) is empty, if we consider α = α ( v l ; v 4 , p 4 ), we ﬁnally obtain H = {( p 1 v 2 p 2 )3 , ( v 1 v 3 qp )4 ,
( v l pl p 3 v 4 α )5 } and R = H ( v l α ; v 5 ).
The proof of the lemma is now complete since all the possible cases have been considered. ✷

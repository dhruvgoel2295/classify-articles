Introduction

The information technology is an important factor in the way
an individual works and lives. Due to the fast development of
information technology, information is becoming increasingly
accessible to each individual and plays an ever more important role in the decision making process. Non-stop access
(unlimited and uninterrupted) to information is important.
This is made possible by the information technology e to be
precise, by the advanced mobile networks and mobile devices.1 The latter enable individual users to have an unforgettable user experience by means of mobile networks and
diverse software. People use mobile devices, among which
smart phones have been on the rise over the last period, for
gaining mobile access to cyberspace. According to research
conducted by IDC (2011), the global sales of smart mobile

phones have been increasing by 55 percent on an annual
basis. The IDC report (2014) showing the sales of smart mobile
phones (as part of the mobile devices' group) indicates that the
sales of such devices exceeded one billion items in 2013 alone.
The sales of other mobile devices (pads, e-watches, etc.) follow
the same trend.
Mobile devices represent an increasingly important factor
in the world of communications. They provide a faster and
more efficient access to information. They are consequently
making the decision process quicker by providing greater access to current information on any given problem. Mobile
devices are not popular only among people in the business
world, but rather among the entire population. As in the real
world, communication is required in order to maintain contact and it is carried out through social portals, including via
mobile devices. Due to the lack of users' knowledge, tools

Mobile devices mostly include devices with an adapted operational system, such as iOS, Android, BlackBerry OS, Windows mobile;
and are portable (mobile phones, tablets, etc.). This category can include all portable devices with a wireless Internet access (including
laptops, portable gaming consoles, industrial readers, etc.). On the other hand, the mobile phone group includes both mobiles phones
intended solely for phone calls and sending short messages and smart mobile phones representing a modern communication device,
which offers a whole range of additional functions, similar to those of a personal computer, in addition to calls through mobile
networks.

providing them with additional protection are currently more
of a hindrance than a benefit.
The study, published by the Ponemon (2011) organisation
in 2011, was carried out to determine the level of awareness
regarding safety and privacy among users (American citizens)
of smart phones. It showed that individuals mainly use smart
phones for various data transmissions from the Internet (in
addition to making phone calls). The equivalent numbers
related to the intended use are interesting (most people have
smart phones for personal as well as business use). On
average, an American citizen spends 2.7 h a day participating
in social networks and socialising through mobile devices,
respectively (Microsoft Tag, 2011). Young people find the
continuous connectivity to the Internet interesting, as it enables access to messaging and the opportunity to use
numerous advanced social network services (Facebook, Google Chat, Twitter, etc.).
Mobile device software is developing at the speed of light,
above all with the intention of attracting users and increasing
sales. Young people forget the traps that are present with the
use of mobile devices, as well the need for additional protection in order to avoid these pitfalls too often.
A mobile device can also be under threat by software
fragments, installed on the device unsupervised, such as
malware and other threats (e.g. spyware, botnets, Bluetooth
connection and social network viruses (Leavitt, 2011)).
Research carried out by Lookout (2011) shows that the number
of malware application-based threats has increased considerably in the second half of 2011, especially compared to
spyware threats, by as much as 14 percent. According to the
Lookout report from 2011, the probability of malware infection
ranges from 1 to 4 percent. The report published by Juniper
Networks (2011) states that the number of Android mobile
devices, infected with malware, increased by 400 percent
since the summer of 2010. The report also found that 85
percent of protection tools on the users' mobile devices is
useless, since (certain) mobile device software manufacturers
take it upon themselves to install “back doors”, enabling them
to manage software settings on the mobile device without the
users' knowledge, have the device automatically send information on where it is located (e.g. GPS location), or even take
control of the mobile device, etc. According to reports published by F-Secure (2013), Juniper Networks (2013) and McAfee
(2013, 2014), the trend of growing threats for mobile devices
continues to rise. Insufficient knowledge of software and of all
features enabled by a mobile device software can get people in
trouble and make them targets of cybercrime. Users of mobile
devices must be conscious of threats and consequences that
they are exposed to, also in order to become aware of the need
for adequate cybersecurity. Users should be able to take some
level of security for granted (e.g. PIN code for the SIM card,
locking of the Bluetooth connection and locking of mobile
devices).
In December 2011, a survey was conducted among students of Slovenian faculties, entitled “Mobile device threat
awareness”. The purpose of the survey was to determine the
extent to which young people are aware of dangers/threats
they are exposed to and what security solutions they have
implemented. The goal of the research is to obtain data on the
purpose, manner and type of the use of mobile devices, and

consequently acquire knowledge about the manner of use,
threats and protection. Conclusions about the users' susceptibility and knowledge of cybercrime can be drawn on the
basis of their knowledge of threats and the safe management
of mobile devices.

Method

The survey was carried out using an online questionnaire,
which was published on the “1ka” portal (www.1ka.si) and
was active for 21 days. Students were informed of the survey/
questionnaire via e-mail, Facebook profiles and in person. The
questionnaire was structured in a way that made it possible to
determine how the mobile device is used and with what
purpose, as well as what types of mobile devices and software
solutions are being used. A section of the questionnaire was
structured so as to provide results, which offer an insight into
the knowledge and use of security solutions, as well as the
knowledge and awareness of threats associated with the use
of mobile devices. Data analysis was performed using the
SPSS software. 281 completed questionnaires were analysed.
The majority of respondents were between 21 and 25 years
old, followed by the group aged 20 or younger; 61.5 percent of
respondents were women; 63.2 percent completed secondary
school education and 36.8 percent were postgraduate
students.
We were trying to determine the knowledge of the use of
mobile devices. In order to achieve that the questionnaire
aimed at establishing what types of mobile devices are used
by the respondents. Fig. 1 shows the numbers and percentages of respondents that use different types of mobile devices.
As shown in Fig. 1, the group that uses a classic mobile
phone (today, many of them also provide a connection to the
Internet) and a laptop computer simultaneously, is the largest.
Almost 27 percent of them already use a smart phone, followed by 20 percent of respondents that use a smart phone, as
well as a laptop computer. On the basis of these results, it is
possible to deduce that respondents use multiple mobile
devices.

Fig. 2 e Intended use of the mobile device.

Fig. 2 shows the intended use of the mobile device. More
than half (58.3 percent) use mobile devices for personal purposes, while a quarter of users use them for personal and
business purposes. The acquired data was to be expected,
given the population of respondents (students). The fact that
the percentage of those using mobile devices for private, as
well as business purposes is still quite high is disconcerting,
particularly if the same mobile device is used. Mixing personal
with business use (mainly data access) namely causes a
problem and the need for adequate cybersecurity is consequently not met. The Ponemon (2011) study offers a similar
example, in which the combined personal and business use
group is just as large (40 percent). Based on both studies, it can
be stated that it is and it will continue to be difficult to draw a
boundary between a personal and professional use of mobile
devices (with the arrival of newer and more advanced mobile
devices).
In order to be aware of the needs regarding the adequate
level of information security when using mobile devices, it is
useful to know what the threats are. Fig. 3 shows the threats
known to respondents.
The knowledge and specific awareness of individual
threats that users of mobile devices face is essential also with

respect to information security. Fig. 3 shows which threats the
respondents were familiar with. It is not surprising that theft,
with almost 90 percent, holds the first place among all listed
threats. However, it is surprising that respondents have such
little knowledge about threats, such as malware, spyware and
rootkit infections, particularly given the fact that the reports
of studies, such as Lookout (2011), Juniper (2011) and McAfee
(2013, 2014), point to a steep increase in infections involving
before mentioned threats.
The perception of threat feasibility (Fig. 4) also depends on
the knowledge of such threats. The results show the number
of respondents who believe that a certain threat can occur.
Again, the number of those, who believe that a theft of a device is possible, is the highest (77.5 percent); the same goes for
those who believe in the possible malware (39.1 percent),
spyware (39.7 percent) and rootkit (45.3 percent) infection.
In order to protect our mobile devices against various
threats, it is advisable to at least be familiar with basic security
measures (Fig. 5). Respondents answered that they mostly use
a PIN code for the SIM card, which was expected. This safety
feature is incorporated into the SIM card by every mobile
telephony provider. However, the cause for concern lies in the
fact that the majority of respondents are familiar with the
mobile device application access PIN code security feature,
but do not use it (56.8 percent). Mobile devices provide this
option automatically. Another security solution that was
considered was the possibility to remotely erase content from
mobile device. This solution is appropriate in the event of loss
or theft of a mobile device. However, only 40 percent of respondents are familiar with this security solution, but still do
not use it; and 52 percent of respondents are not familiar with
the said security solution at all. Considering the data in Fig. 5,
where most believe that a theft of the device is most likely, the
knowledge of this solution could be very beneficial. All of the
above listed aspects of how to secure a mobile device should
be provided to users through education. Such training could

be general in nature and focus on how to secure all models of
mobile devices or very specific by focusing on individual
model types and software solutions. Regardless, when
considering the survey data, it becomes clear that the situation will have to improve considerably, since more than 42
percent of respondents know about a security solution, but do
not use it, and almost 39 percent of them are not familiar with
any at all.
Threat probability assessment relating to smart phone use
was made by measuring 25 variables and performing a factor
analysis. Services made available to the user via their smart

phone were listed and respondents were asked to evaluate the
likelihood of the occurrence of a threat when using an individual service (rated from 1 ¼ never to 5 ¼ always).
In the performed factor analysis (Fig. 6) the variables were
divided among three factors (using the Varimax perpendicular
rotation method with Kaiser Normalisation), using the principal components method. The first factor was entitled
“Working with the Internet and data transmission” and contains mobile device services pertaining to data transmission
and working in cyberspace. Within the framework of this
factor, there is a probability of the occurrence of a threat when

working using the Internet and transmitting data while using
a mobile device. The probability is greatest during the transmission of different content. The second factor was entitled
“Automatic data transmission”. It was possible to observe that
there is a probability of the occurrence of a threat when
automatically transmitting data. E-mail synchronisation is
the highest placed variable in this threat probability assessment factor, followed by calendar synchronisation and contacts synchronisation. In the third group of variables that was
established, there is a probability of the occurrence of a threat
while working using a mobile device. The probability is highest with the messaging variable, followed by taking photos
and listening to music.
The Cronbach's Alfa coefficient of reliability in this factor
analysis is 0.974, which signifies high reliability and proves
that a replication of this survey would give similar results. The
total variance amounts to 75.752 percent.
On the basis of presented data it can be concluded that the
use of mobile devices in cyberspace can result in the occurrence of particular threats; users should therefore employ
suitable work methods and ensure protection against threats
in an appropriate manner, as presented bellow.

Discussion

By examining numerous theoretical findings and research, the
authors find that the use and usability of mobile devices is on
the increase, as are the threats. Mobile devices are used for
different purposes, but the most common are those associated with the possibility of continuous communication and
access to information. The area of software offers numerous
applications facilitating the users' work by allowing them to
download information from cyberspace.
Despite the popularity of mobile devices, the users too
often do not realise that they must ensure safe use themselves. Therefore, the knowledge of threats that the users of
mobile devices may face and the use of security measures are
essential. The use of necessary security solutions derives from
knowing the threats. However, ignorance in this area creates
doubt about the individual's knowledge and use of security
solutions. The survey we presented clearly shows a poor
knowledge of respondents with regard to threats to mobile
devices. The threats they are familiar with are general, while
knowledge of specific, more complex threats e those that are
most on the rise e is lacking. The same is true for the use of
security features. The most commonly used simple security
features of mobile devices have been around for a long time
(e.g. PIN code), while the use and knowledge of more sophisticated security measures is insufficient. The finding, which
the authors find interesting, is that despite knowing the
numerous dangers that threaten the users' mobile devices,
they still do not believe that this could happen to them.
Consequently, potential risks are consciously disregarded.
The results show that respondents mostly use their mobile
devices for the purpose of communicating with their peers.
The software and methods they use differ greatly. In

89

accordance with current research, the use of mobile devices
will continue to increase. There will be an ever greater number
of advanced applications that will provide greater and faster
access to data. In the flood of different mobile devices and a
variety of software, one must not forget the importance of
privacy, information security and the establishment of a
comprehensive cybersecurity. Education and awareness
raising among users must be put at the core of said provisions.
Users must be made aware of methods for the safe use of
mobile devices, various threats and potential consequences of
their materialisation, and the importance of using security
features. Once a threat becomes a reality and data is misappropriated, there is no going back. Therefore, the necessary
level of security must be implemented beforehand.

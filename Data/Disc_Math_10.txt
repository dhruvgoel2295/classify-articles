abstract
Bertrand, Charon, Hudry and Lobstein studied, in their paper in 2004 [1], r-locating–
dominating codes in paths Pn . They conjectured that if r ≥ 2 is a fixed integer, then
the smallest cardinality of an r-locating–dominating code in Pn , denoted by MrLD (Pn ),
satisfies MrLD (Pn ) = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ for infinitely many values of n. We prove that this
conjecture holds. In fact, we show a stronger result saying that for any r ≥ 3 we have
MrLD (Pn ) = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ for all n ≥ nr when nr is large enough. In addition, we solve a
conjecture on location–domination with segments of even length in the infinite path.

1. Introduction
Let G = (V , E ) be a simple connected and undirected graph with V as the set of vertices and E as the set of edges. Let u
and v be vertices in V . If u and v are adjacent to each other, then the edge between u and v is denoted by uv . The distance
d(u, v) is the number of edges in any shortest path between u and v . Let r be a positive integer. We say that u r-covers v if
the distance d(u, v) is at most r. The ball of radius r centered at u is defined as
Br (u) = {x ∈ V | d(u, x) ≤ r }.
A nonempty subset of V is called a code, and its elements are called codewords. Let C ⊆ V be a code and u be a vertex in
V . An I-set (or an identifying set) of the vertex u with respect to the code C is defined as
Ir (C ; u) = Ir (u) = Br (u) ∩ C .
Definition 1.1. Let r be a positive integer. A code C ⊆ V is said to be r-locating–dominating in G if for all u, v ∈ V \ C the
set Ir (C ; u) is nonempty and
Ir (C ; u) ̸= Ir (C ; v).
Let X and Y be subsets of V . The symmetric difference of X and Y is defined as X Y = (X \ Y ) ∪ (Y \ X ). We
say that the vertices u and v are r-separated by a code C ⊆ V (or by a codeword of C ) if the symmetric difference
Ir (C ; u) Ir (C ; v) is nonempty. The definition of r-locating–dominating codes can now be reformulated as follows: C ⊆ V

is an r-locating–dominating code in G if and only if for all u, v ∈ V \ C the vertex u is r-covered by a codeword of C and
Ir (C ; u) Ir (C ; v) ̸= ∅.
The smallest cardinality of an r-locating–dominating code in a finite graph G is denoted by MrLD (G). Notice that there
always exists an r-locating–dominating code in G. An r-locating–dominating code attaining the smallest cardinality is called
optimal. In [4], it is shown that the problem of determining MrLD (G) is NP-hard.
Locating–dominating codes are also known as locating–dominating sets in the literature. The concept of locating–dominating codes was first introduced by Slater in [13,15,16] and later generalized by Carson in [3]. Locating–dominating codes have been since studied in various papers such as [2,6,7,9,10,14,17–19]. For other papers on the
subject, we refer to the Web site [12]. Moreover, location–domination in paths has been examined in [1,8] (for cycles see [5]).
Let n be a positive integer. A path Pn = (Vn , En ) is a graph such that the set of vertices is defined as Vn = {vi | i =
0, 1, . . . , n − 1} and the set of edges is defined as
En = {vi vi+1 | i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 2}.
In [15], Slater showed that M1LD (Pn ) = ⌈2n/5⌉. Bertrand et al. [1] provide the following lower bound for r ≥ 2.

Moreover, in [1], it is conjectured that for any fixed r ≥ 2, there exist infinitely many values of n such that MrLD (Pn ) attains
the previous lower bound. In [8], it is shown that M2LD (Pn ) = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ for any n. Hence, the conjecture holds when r = 2.
In Sections 4 and 5, we prove that the conjecture also holds when r ≥ 3. Moreover, we show that for any r ≥ 3 we have
MrLD (Pn ) = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ for all n ≥ nr when nr is large enough (nr = O (r 3 )).
In Section 2, we begin by introducing some basic results concerning r-locating–dominating codes in paths. In Section 3,
we continue by considering r-locating–dominating codes in paths Pn with small n (compared to r). Then, in Section 5, we
present optimal 3- and 4-locating–dominating codes in Pn for all n. Finally, in Section 6, we solve the conjecture stated
in [1, Conjecture 2], which considers location-domination with segments of even lengths in the infinite path.
2. Basics
Let C be a nonempty subset of Vn . We first present a useful characterization of r-locating–dominating codes in paths. For
this, we need the concept of C -consecutive vertices introduced in [1]. Let i and j be positive integers such that 0 ≤ i < j ≤
n − 1. We say that (vi , vj ) is a pair of C -consecutive vertices in Pn if vi , vj ∈ Vn \ C and vk ∈ C for 0 ≤ i < k < j ≤ n − 1.
Now we are ready to present the following characterization, which is introduced in [1, Remark 3].
Lemma 2.1 ([1]). Let r be a positive integer. A code C ⊆ Vn is r-locating–dominating in Pn if and only if each vertex u ∈ Vn \ C
is r-covered by a codeword of C and for each pair (u, v) of C -consecutive vertices in Pn the vertices u and v are r-separated by
a codeword of C .
The following theorem provides a handy property on the size of the optimal r-locating–dominating codes in Pn .
Theorem 2.2. Let n and r be positive integers. Then we have
MrLD (Pn ) ≤ MrLD (Pn+1 ) ≤ MrLD (Pn ) + 1.
Proof. Consider first the inequality MrLD (Pn ) ≤ MrLD (Pn+1 ). Let C ⊆ Vn+1 = {v0 , v1 , . . . , vn } be an r-locating–dominating
code in Pn+1 . Assume first that the vertex vn ̸∈ C . Now it is obvious that C is also an r-locating–dominating code in Pn .
Assume then that vn ∈ C . Denote by X the set of pairs of C -consecutive vertices in Pn . There exists at most one pair
(u, v) ∈ X such that the codeword vn belongs to the symmetric difference of Ir (u) and Ir (v). If there is no such pair of
C -consecutive vertices, then it is clear that (C \ {vn }) ∪ {vn−1 } is an r-locating–dominating code in Pn . Assume then that
(vi , vj ) with i < j is the unique pair of C -consecutive vertices such that vn ∈ Ir (vi ) Ir (vj ). Now define C ′ = (C \ {vn }) ∪ {vj }.
Since all the pairs of C -consecutive vertices belonging to X \ {(vi , vj )} are r-separated by a codeword of C ′ , then it is easy
to conclude that all the pairs of C ′ -consecutive vertices are r-separated by a codeword of C ′ in Pn . Notice that if a vertex
is r-covered by vn , then it is also r-covered by vj . Therefore, each vertex in Vn is r-covered by a codeword of C ′ . Thus, by
Lemma 2.1, C ′ is an r-locating–dominating code in Pn . In conclusion, we have MrLD (Pn ) ≤ MrLD (Pn+1 ).
Let then C ⊆ Vn be an r-locating–dominating code in Pn . Since C ∪ {vn } is an r-locating–dominating code in Pn+1 , we
immediately have MrLD (Pn+1 ) ≤ MrLD (Pn ) + 1.
In what follows, we present a couple of lemmas that are useful in determining the smallest cardinalities of
r-locating–dominating codes in paths with a small number of vertices in Section 3. The first lemma says that an
r-locating–dominating code in Pn is such that at least r of both the first and the last 2r + 1 vertices of the path are codewords.

Lemma 2.3. Let C be an r-locating–dominating code in Pn and n be an integer such that n ≥ 2r + 1.
(i) The intersection C ∩ {v0 , v1 , . . . , v2r } contains at least r vertices.
(ii) The intersection C ∩ {vn−2r −1 , vn−2r , . . . , vn−1 } contains at least r vertices.
Proof. Let C be an r-locating–dominating code in Pn . Denote {v0 , v1 , . . . , vr } by Qr . Assume that there are k codewords
in C ∩ Qr with 0 ≤ k ≤ r − 1. (Notice that if k ≥ r, then the case (i) immediately follows.) Now there are r − k
pairs (u, v) of C -consecutive vertices such that u ∈ Qr and v ∈ Qr . Notice that if (u, v) and (u′ , v ′ ) are such pairs of
C -consecutive vertices, then the symmetric differences Ir (u) Ir (v) and Ir (u′ ) Ir (v ′ ) are subsets of {vr +1 , vr +2 , . . . , v2r }
and the intersection of the symmetric differences Ir (u) Ir (v) and Ir (u′ ) Ir (v ′ ) is empty. Hence, there are at least r − k
codewords in {vr +1 , vr +2 , . . . , v2r }. Thus, the claim (i) follows.
The case (ii) follows by symmetry.
The second lemma says that an r-locating–dominating code in Pn is such that any set of 3r + 1 consecutive vertices in
the path contains at least r codewords.
Lemma 2.4. Let C be an r-locating–dominating code in Pn and n be an integer such that n ≥ 3r + 1. For i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 3r − 1,
the set

{vi , vi+1 , . . . , vi+3r } ⊆ Vn
contains at least r codewords of C .
Proof. Let C be an r-locating–dominating code in Pn and i be an integer such that 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 3r − 1. Denote
{vi+r , vi+r +1 , . . . , vi+2r } by Qr . Assume that there are k codewords in C ∩ Qr with 0 ≤ k ≤ r − 1. Now there are r − k
pairs (u, v) of C -consecutive vertices such that u ∈ Qr and v ∈ Qr . Notice that if (u, v) and (u′ , v ′ ) are such pairs
of C -consecutive vertices, then it is easy to see that the symmetric differences Ir (u) Ir (v) and Ir (u′ ) Ir (v ′ ) are subsets
of {vi , vi+1 , . . . , vi+r −1 } ∪ {vi+2r +1 , vi+2r +2 , . . . , vi+3r } and the intersection of the symmetric differences Ir (u) Ir (v) and
Ir (u′ ) Ir (v ′ ) is empty. Hence, there are at least r − k codewords in {vi , vi+1 , . . . , vi+r −1 } ∪ {vi+2r +1 , vi+2r +2 , . . . , vi+3r }.
Thus, the claim follows.
3. Paths with a small number of vertices
Let r be a positive integer. In this section, we determine the exact values of MrLD (Pn ) when 1 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3. We also
present a new lower bound on MrLD (Pn ) (improving the previous lower bound of Theorem 1.2) for some specific lengths n
of the paths.
Consider then the exact values of MrLD (Pn ) when 1 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3. Clearly, we have MrLD (P1 ) = 1. The exact values
of MrLD (Pn ), when 2 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3, are given in the following theorem. Previously, in [1], it has been shown that
MrLD (P3r +1 ) = MrLD (P3r +2 ) = r + 1 and MrLD (P3r +3 ) = r + 2.
Theorem 3.1. Let r be an integer such that r ≥ 2. Then we have the following results for 2 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3:

2 ≤ n ≤ r + 1, then MrLD (Pn ) = n − 1.
r + 2 ≤ n ≤ 2r + 1, then MrLD (Pn ) = r.
2r + 2 ≤ n ≤ 3r + 2, then MrLD (Pn ) = r + 1.
n = 3r + 3, then MrLD (Pn ) = r + 2.
3r + 4 ≤ n ≤ 4r + 2, then MrLD (Pn ) = n − 2(r + 1).
4r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 5r + 2, then MrLD (Pn ) = 2r.
5r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 6r + 2, then MrLD (Pn ) = 2r + 1.
6r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 6r + 5, then MrLD (Pn ) = 2r + 2.
6r + 6 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3, then MrLD (Pn ) = n − 4r − 3.

Proof. Let C be an r-locating–dominating code in Pn .
(1) Assume that 2 ≤ n ≤ r +1. Now it is obvious that Br (u) = Vn for all u ∈ Vn . Hence, it is immediate that Mr (Pn ) = n−1.
(2) Assume that r + 2 ≤ n ≤ 2r + 1. Now, by Theorem 2.2, we have MrLD (Pn ) ≥ MrLD (Pr +1 ) = r. On the other hand,
using Lemma 2.1, it is easy to verify that D2 = {v0 , v1 , . . . , vr −2 } ∪ {v2r } is an r-locating–dominating code in P2r +1 with r
codewords. Therefore, by Theorem 2.2, MrLD (Pn ) = r when r + 2 ≤ n ≤ 2r + 1.
(3) Assume that 2r + 2 ≤ n ≤ 3r + 2. Consider first the path P2r +2 . It is easy to conclude that each codeword can
r-separate at most one pair of C -consecutive vertices in P2r +2 . The number of pairs of C -consecutive vertices in P2r +2 is
equal to 2r + 2 − |C | − 1. Therefore, we have the following inequality:

|C | ≥ 2r + 1 − |C | ⇐⇒ |C | ≥

2r + 1
2

.

Thus, by the previous inequality and Theorem 2.2, MrLD (Pn ) ≥ MrLD (P2r +2 ) ≥ r + 1. The code D3 = {vr , vr +1 , . . . , v2r −1 } ∪
{v3r } introduced in [1] is r-locating–dominating in P3r +2 . Therefore, MrLD (Pn ) = r + 1 when 2r + 2 ≤ n ≤ 3r + 2.

(4) In [1], it is shown that D4 = {v0 } ∪ {vr +1 , vr +2 , . . . , v2r } ∪ {v3r +2 } is an r-locating–dominating code in P3r +3 . Hence,
by Theorem 1.2, we have MrLD (P3r +3 ) = r + 2.
(5) Assume that 3r + 4 ≤ n ≤ 4r + 2. Now we can denote n = 3r + 3 + p, where 1 ≤ p ≤ r − 1. By Lemma 2.3,
subsets {v0 , v1 , . . . , v2r } and {vr +p+2 , vr +p+3 , . . . , v3r +p+2 } both contain at least r codewords of C . The number of vertices
in the intersection of these subsets is equal to r − p − 1. Therefore, we have

|C | ≥ r − p − 1 + 2(r − (r − p − 1)) = r + p + 1.
On the other hand, using Lemma 2.1, it is straightforward to verify that D5 = {v1 } ∪ {vr +2 , vr +3 , . . . , v2r +p } ∪ {v3r +p+1 } is
an r-locating–dominating code in Pn . Thus, MrLD (P3r +3+p ) = r + p + 1 = n − 2(r + 1) when 3r + 4 ≤ n ≤ 4r + 2.
(6) Assume that 4r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 5r + 2. By Theorem 2.2, we have MrLD (Pn ) ≥ MrLD (P4r +2 ) = 2r. Then define
D6 = {v0 } ∪ {vr +2 , vr +3 , . . . , v2r } ∪ {v3r +1 , v3r +2 , . . . , v4r −1 } ∪ {v5r +1 }.
The number of vertices in D6 is equal to 2r and, by Lemma 2.1, it can be easily verified that D6 is an r-locating–dominating
code in P5r +2 . Therefore, by Theorem 2.2, MrLD (Pn ) = 2r when 4r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 5r + 2.
(7) Assume that 5r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 6r + 2. Let us first show that MrLD (P5r +3 ) ≥ 2r + 1. Assume to the contrary that C is an
r-locating–dominating code in P5r +3 with at most 2r codewords. By Lemma 2.3, we know that both {v0 , v1 , . . . , v2r } and
{v3r +2 , v3r +3 , . . . , v5r +2 } contain at least r codewords of C . Hence, there are no codewords of C in {v2r +1 , v2r +2 , . . . , v3r +1 }.
Therefore, since all the pairs (u, v) of C -consecutive vertices in P5r +3 such that u, v ∈ {v0 , v1 , . . . , v2r +1 } are r-separated
by a codeword of C , then the codewords of C belonging to {v0 , v1 , . . . , v2r +1 } form an r-locating–dominating code in P2r +2
with r codewords. This is a contradiction with the case (3). Thus, by Theorem 2.2, MrLD (Pn ) ≥ MrLD (P5r +3 ) ≥ 2r + 1. Define
then
D7 = {vr , vr +1 , . . . , v2r −1 } ∪ {v3r } ∪ {v4r +2 , v4r +3 , . . . , v5r } ∪ {v5r +2 }.
Using Lemma 2.1, it is straightforward to verify that D7 is an r-locating–dominating code in P6r +2 with 2r + 1 codewords.
Thus, MrLD (Pn ) = 2r + 1 when 5r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 6r + 2.
(8) Assume that 6r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 6r + 5. By Theorem 1.2, we have MrLD (Pn ) ≥ 2r + 2. Define then
D8 = {v1 , vr +1 } ∪ {vr +3 , vr +4 , . . . , v2r } ∪ {v3r +1 , v3r +3 } ∪ {v4r +4 , v4r +5 , . . . , v5r +1 } ∪ {v5r +3 , v6r +3 }.
By Lemma 2.1, D8 is an r-locating–dominating code in P6r +5 with 2r + 2 vertices. Thus, MrLD (Pn ) = 2r + 2 when
6r + 3 ≤ n ≤ 6r + 5.
(9) Assume that 6r + 6 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3. Now we can denote n = 6r + 5 + p, where 1 ≤ p ≤ r − 2. Consider first
the path P7r +3 . By Lemma 2.3, the subsets {v0 , v1 , . . . , v2r } and {v5r +2 , v5r +3 , . . . , v7r +2 } of V7r +3 both contain at least r
codewords of C . By Lemma 2.4, the same also holds for the subset {v2r +1 , v2r +2 , . . . , v5r +1 }. Therefore, MrLD (P7r +3 ) ≥ 3r.
Thus, by Theorem 2.2 and the fact that MrLD (P6r +5 ) = 2r + 2, we have MrLD (P6r +5+p ) = 2r + 2 + p when 1 ≤ p ≤ r − 2. In
other words, MrLD (Pn ) = n − 4r − 3 when 6r + 6 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3.
By generalizing the lower bound in the case (9) of the previous proof, the following theorem is immediately obtained.
Theorem 3.2. Let r be a positive integer and n = 2(2r + 1) + p(3r + 1) where p ≥ 0 is an integer. Then we have
MrLD (Pn ) ≥ (p + 2)r .
Using the notations of the previous theorem, the lower bound of Theorem 1.2 implies that
MrLD (Pn ) ≥

n+1



= (p + 1)r + 1 +

.

By straightforward calculations, it can be shown that (p + 2)r > (p + 1)r + 1 + ⌈(r + p)/3⌉ if and only if 0 ≤ p ≤ 2r − 6.
Thus, the previous theorem gives improvements on the previously known lower bound when n = 2(2r + 1) + p(3r + 1)
and 0 ≤ p ≤ 2r − 6.
By applying Theorem 2.2 to the previous lower bound, we also obtain new lower bounds for some other values of n. For
example, by Theorem 1.2, we have M5LD (P56 ) ≥ 19. However, by Theorem 3.2, we have M5LD (P54 ) ≥ 20 and, therefore,
M5LD (P56 ) ≥ M5LD (P54 ) ≥ 20.
The values given by the lower bound of Theorem 3.2 are sometimes optimal. For example, when r = 5 and p = 4, we
have M5LD (P86 ) ≥ 30. On the other hand,
D86 = {v2 , v6 , v8 , v9 , v10 , v12 , v17 , v21 , v24 , v25 , v27 , v29 , v33 , v37 , v41 , v43 , v45 , v46 ,

v53 , v55 , v59 , v61 , v62 , v63 , v71 , v75 , v76 , v78 , v79 , v83 }
is a 5-locating–dominating code in P86 . Therefore, M5LD (P86 ) = 30.

4. Paths with a large number of vertices
Let n be a positive integer and r be an integer such that r ≥ 5. In this section, we show that the size of an optimal
r-locating–dominating code in Pn is equal to ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ for all n ≥ nr when nr is large enough. The proof of this is based on
the result of Theorem 4.3 saying that if n = 3r + 2 + p((r − 3)(6r + 3) + 3r + 3) + q(6r + 3), where p and q are non-negative
integers, then we have MrLD (Pn ) ≤ ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉. The proof of Theorem 4.3 is illustrated in the following example when
r = 5.
Example 4.1. Assume that r = 5. Let p and q be non-negative integers. In what follows, we show that if n = 3r + 2 +
p((r − 3)(6r + 3) + 3r + 3) + q(6r + 3) = 17 + 84p + 33q, then M5LD (Pn ) ≤ ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉. In Figs. 1 and 2, first consider
the pattern D (the upper dashed box in the figures), which is formed by concatenating the patterns K1 , K2 and K3 , which are
of lengths 6r + 3, 6r + 3 and 3r + 3, respectively. The pattern D is of length (r − 3)(6r + 3) + 3r + 3 = 84 and contains
((r − 3)(6r + 3) + 3r + 3)/3 = 28 codewords, i.e. 1/3 of the vertices of D are codewords. Moreover, it is easy to verify
that D is a 5-locating–dominating code in a cycle of length 84 (compare this with Lemma 4.2). Similarly, the pattern (the
lower dashed box in the figures) formed by K1 and L2 , which is of length 2(6r + 3) = 66 and contains (2(6r + 3))/3 = 22
codewords, is a 5-locating–dominating code in a cycle of length 66.
The actual 5-locating–dominating code in Pn depends on the parity of q. Assume first that q is even, i.e. q = 2q′ for some
integer q′ . The code C1 is now defined as in Fig. 1, where the pattern D is repeated p times and the pattern formed by K1 and
L2 is repeated q′ times. Since the patterns D and the one formed by K1 and L2 are 5-locating–dominating codes, respectively,
in cycles of lengths 84 and 66, it is straightforward to verify that C1 is a 5-locating–dominating code in Pn (by Lemma 2.1).
Similarly, it can be shown that the code C2 defined in Fig. 2 is 5-locating–dominating in Pn when q is odd, i.e. q = 2q′ + 1
for some integer q′ . Therefore, if n = 17 + 84p + 33q, we have MrLD (Pn ) ≤ 6 + 28p + 11q = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉.
For the formal proof of Theorem 4.3, we first need to introduce some preliminary definitions and results. Let i and s be
non-negative integers. First, for 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 2, define

and Mi′ (s) = Mi (s) \ {vs+2r −i }. Notice that |Mi (s)| = r. Furthermore, for 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 3, define

Notice that |L1 (s)| = 3r + 1 and |Li (s)| = 2r + 1 when 2 ≤ i ≤ r − 2.
As in Example 4.1, denote by Ki , Li and Mi the patterns {vs , vs+1 , . . . , vs+ℓ−1 } where the codewords are determined by
Ki (s), Li (s) and Mi (s), respectively. The length ℓ of each pattern Ki and Li is equal to three times the number of codewords in
the pattern. For example, the length of the pattern L1 is equal to 9r + 3 (see the case (iv) below). The length of the pattern
Mi is equal to 2r + 1. The following lemma says for general r ≥ 5 that the patterns Ki , Li and Mi can be concatenated to form
r-locating dominating codes as in Example 4.1 (because the beginning of each of them contains Mi′ (s)).
Lemma 4.2. Let n and s be positive integers, and let r be an integer such that r ≥ 5. Let C be a code in Pn .
(i) Let i be an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 3. If Ki (s) ∪ Mi′+1 (s + 6r + 3) ⊆ C , then each pair (vj1 , vj2 ) of C -consecutive
vertices in Pn such that s ≤ j1 ≤ s + 7r + 2 and s ≤ j2 ≤ s + 7r + 2 is r-separated by a codeword of C .
(ii) If Kr −2 (s) ∪ M1′ (s + 3r + 3) ⊆ C , then each pair (vj1 , vj2 ) of C -consecutive vertices in Pn such that s ≤ j1 ≤ s + 4r + 2
and s ≤ j2 ≤ s + 4r + 2 is r-separated by a codeword of C .
(iii) Let i be an integer such that 2 ≤ i ≤ r − 2. If Li (s) ∪ Mi′−1 (s + 6r + 3) ⊆ C , then each pair (vj1 , vj2 ) of C -consecutive
vertices in Pn such that s ≤ j1 ≤ s + 7r + 2 and s ≤ j2 ≤ s + 7r + 2 is r-separated by a codeword of C .
(iv) If L1 (s) ∪ Mr′ −2 (s + 9r + 3) ⊆ C , then each pair (vj1 , vj2 ) of C -consecutive vertices in Pn such that s ≤ j1 ≤ s + 10r + 2
and s ≤ j2 ≤ s + 10r + 2 is r-separated by a codeword of C .
Proof. (i) Let i be an integer with 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 3 and C ⊆ Vn a code such that Ki (s) ∪ Mi′+1 (s + 6r + 3) ⊆ C . Consider then
the symmetric differences Br (vj1 ) Br (vj2 ), where (vj1 , vj2 ) are pairs of C -consecutive vertices such that s ≤ j1 ≤ s + 7r + 2
and s ≤ j2 ≤ s + 7r + 2. For the following considerations, notice that

Let k be a positive integer. If s + r ≤ k ≤ s + 2r − i − 2, s + 2r − i ≤ k ≤ s + 2r − 2, s + 4r + 2 ≤ k ≤ s + 5r − i − 2
or s + 5r − i + 1 ≤ k ≤ s + 5r, then it is straightforward to verify that the vertex vk−r belongs to the symmetric difference
Ir (vk ) Ir (vk+1 ). If s + 2r + 1 ≤ k ≤ s + 3r − i − 2, s + 3r − i + 1 ≤ k ≤ s + 3r − 1, s + 5r + 3 ≤ k ≤ s + 6r − i − 1 or
s + 6r − i + 1 ≤ k ≤ s + 6r + 1, then it can be seen that the vertex vk+r +1 belongs to the symmetric difference Ir (vk ) Ir (vk+1 ).
Moreover, we have that

vs+2r ∈ Ir (vs+r −i−1 ) Ir (vs+r ),
vs+3r −i ∈ Ir (vs+2r −i−1 ) Ir (vs+2r −i ),

In conclusion, all the pairs (vj1 , vj2 ) of C -consecutive vertices in Pn such that s ≤ j1 ≤ s + 7r + 2 and s ≤ j2 ≤ s + 7r + 2
are r-separated by a codeword of C .
The proofs of the cases (ii), (iii) and (iv) are analogous to the first one.
The following theorem now proves the conjecture stated in [1, Conjecture 1] when r ≥ 5.
Theorem 4.3. Let r ≥ 5 be an integer and n = 3r + 2 + p((r − 3)(6r + 3)+ 3r + 3)+ q(6r + 3), where p and q are non-negative
integers. Then we have

Proof. Let r ≥ 5 be an integer and n = 3r + 2 + p((r − 3)(6r + 3) + 3r + 3) + q(6r + 3), where p and q are non-negative
integers. Let s be a non-negative integer and define

Notice that if r = 5, this definition of C1 coincides with the one of Example 4.1. (Recall also the length of the patterns Ki , Li
and Mi as described earlier.) As in the previous example, C1 is formed by concatenating the patterns Ki , Li and Mi . Since
Mi′ (s) ⊆ Ki (s) and Mi′ (s) ⊆ Li (s), Lemma 4.2 applies to each occurrence of Ki (s) and Li (s) in C1 . Therefore, each pair (vj , vk )
of C1 -consecutive vertices in Pn such that r + 1 ≤ j ≤ n − r − 2 and r + 1 ≤ k ≤ n − r − 2 is r-separated by a codeword
of C1 . Hence, it is easy to see that each pair of C1 -consecutive vertices in Pn is r-separated by C1 . Since there are no 2r + 1
consecutive vertices belonging to Vn \ C1 in Pn , all the vertices in Pn are r-covered by a codeword of C1 . Thus, by Lemma 2.1,
it is easy to conclude that C1 is an r-locating–dominating code in Pn with ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ vertices.
Assume then that q is odd, i.e. q = 2q′ + 1 for some integer q′ . Define then

Similarly, as in the previous case, it can be shown that C2 is an r-locating–dominating code in Pn with ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉
vertices.
In [11, Theorem 8.3], the following theorem is presented. This theorem turns out useful in future considerations.
Theorem 4.4 ([11]). Let a and b be positive integers such that the greatest common divisor of a and b is equal to 1. Then, for any
integer n > ab − a − b, there exist such non-negative integers p and q that n = pa + qb.
The length of the path in Theorem 4.3 can be written as follows:
n = 3r + 2 + p((r − 3)(6r + 3) + 3r + 3) + q(6r + 3)

= 3r + 2 + 3(p((r − 3)(2r + 1) + r + 1) + q(2r + 1)).

1870

G. Exoo et al. / Discrete Mathematics 311 (2011) 1863–1873

The greatest common divisor of (r − 3)(2r + 1)+ r + 1 and 2r + 1 is equal to 1. Thus, by Theorem 4.4, if n′ is an integer such that
n′ ≥ 2r ((r − 3)(2r + 1)+ r ), then there exist non-negative integers p and q such that n′ = p((r − 3)(2r + 1)+ r + 1)+ q(2r + 1).
Therefore, if n is an integer such that n ≥ 3r + 2 + 3 · 2r ((r − 3)(2r + 1) + r ) and n ≡ 2(mod 3), then there exist integers
p ≥ 0 and q ≥ 0 such that n = 3r + 2 + p((r − 3)(6r + 3) + 3r + 3) + q(6r + 3).
Assume that n ≥ 3r + 2 + 6r ((r − 3)(2r + 1) + r ) and n = 3k + 2, where k is an integer. Combining the lower bound
of Theorems 1.2, 2.2 and 4.3, we obtain
k + 1 ≤ MrLD (P3k ) ≤ MrLD (P3k+1 ) ≤ MrLD (P3k+2 ) ≤ k + 1.
Therefore, MrLD (P3k ) = MrLD (P3k+1 ) = MrLD (P3k+2 ) = k + 1. Thus, the following theorem immediately follows.
Theorem 4.5. Let r be a positive integer such that r ≥ 5. If n ≥ 3r + 2 + 6r ((r − 3)(2r + 1) + r ), then
MrLD (Pn ) =

Theorem 4.3 provides one approach to form r-locating–dominating codes in paths using Lemma 4.2. However, this lemma
can also be applied in other ways. For example, when k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ r − 3,

is an optimal r-locating–dominating code in Pn with n = 12r + 5 + k(6r + 3). Notice that the optimal r-locating–dominating
codes in paths of these lengths cannot be obtained using Theorem 4.3.
5. The exact values of M3LD (Pn ) and M4LD (Pn )
Let n be a positive integer. In this section, we solve the exact values of M3LD (Pn ) and M4LD (Pn ) for all n. In order to do this,
we first need to present some preliminary definitions and results.
Define an infinite path P∞ = (V∞ , E∞ ), where V∞ = {vi | i ∈ Z} and E∞ = {vi vi+1 | i ∈ Z}. Define then
C = {vi ∈ V∞ | i ≡ 0, 2 mod 6}.
In [8], it is stated that if r is an integer such that r ≥ 2 and r ≡ 1, 2, 3 or 4(mod 6), then C is an r-locating–dominating code
in P∞ . This result is rephrased in the following lemma when r = 3 or r = 4.
Lemma 5.1. Let n and k be integers such that
D = {vk , vk+2 , vk+6 , vk+8 , vk+12 , vk+14 } ⊆ Vn .
If a pair (vi , vj ) of D-consecutive vertices in Pn is such that k + 5 ≤ i ≤ k + 13 and k + 5 ≤ j ≤ k + 13, then vi and vj are
3- and 4-separated by a codeword of D. Moreover, each vertex vi ∈ Vn \ D such that k + 6 ≤ i ≤ k + 11 is 3- and 4-covered by
a codeword of D.
Consider then r-locating–dominating codes in Pn when r = 3. By Theorem 3.1, the exact values of M3LD (Pn ) are known
when 1 ≤ n ≤ 24. Let p be an integer such that p ≥ 1. Define

i=0

It is straightforward to verify that D1 (1) and D2 (1) are 3-locating–dominating codes in P26 and P29 , respectively. Therefore,
using Lemma 5.1, it is easy to conclude that D1 (p) and D2 (p) are 3-locating–dominating codes in P20+6p and P23+6p ,
respectively, when p ≥ 2. Moreover, by Theorems 1.2 and 2.2, we have

|D1 (p)| ≥ M3LD (P20+6p ) ≥ M3LD (P19+6p ) ≥ M3LD (P18+6p ) ≥ 7 + 2p
and

|D2 (p)| ≥ M3LD (P23+6p ) ≥ M3LD (P22+6p ) ≥ M3LD (P21+6p ) ≥ 8 + 2p.
Since |D1 (p)| = 7 + 2p and |D2 (p)| = 8 + 2p, we have that M3LD (Pn ) = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ for any n ≥ 24. In conclusion, all the
values of M3LD (Pn ) are determined.

Consider then r-locating–dominating codes in Pn when r = 4. By Theorem 3.1, the exact values of M4LD (Pn ) are known
when 1 ≤ n ≤ 31. Assume now that p ≥ 0. Define

D3 (p) = {v1 , v5 , v7 , v8 } ∪

∪{v31+6p , v34+6p , v36+6p , v39+6p , v42+6p , v47+6p , v49+6p , v50+6p , v53+6p }.
It is straightforward to verify that D3 (0), D3 (1), D4 (0) and D4 (1) are 4-locating–dominating codes in P29 , P35 , P56 and P62 ,
respectively. Therefore, using Lemma 5.1, it is easy to conclude that D1 (p) and D2 (p) are 4-locating–dominating codes in
P29+6p and P56+6p , respectively, when p ≥ 2. Moreover, by Theorems 1.2 and 2.2, we have
|D3 (p)| ≥ M4LD (P29+6p ) ≥ M4LD (P28+6p ) ≥ M4LD (P27+6p ) ≥ 10 + 2p
and

|D4 (p)| ≥ M4LD (P56+6p ) ≥ M4LD (P55+6p ) ≥ M4LD (P54+6p ) ≥ 19 + 2p.
Since |D3 (p)| = 10 + 2p and |D4 (p)| = 19 + 2p, we have that M4LD (Pn ) = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ when 27 + 6p ≤ n ≤ 29 + 6p and
54 + 6p ≤ n ≤ 56 + 6p (p ≥ 0). In conclusion, the values of M4LD (Pn ) are determined except when n = 32, 36 ≤ n ≤
38, 42 ≤ n ≤ 44 or 48 ≤ n ≤ 50.
By Theorem 3.1, we have M4LD (P31 ) = 12. Therefore, by Theorem 2.2, since M4LD (P35 ) = 12, we also have that
LD
M4 (P32 ) = 12. Define then
D37 = {v2 , v3 , v5 , v6 , v13 , v16 , v17 , v19 , v23 , v29 , v30 , v31 , v33 },
D43 = {v2 , v3 , v5 , v8 , v10 , v16 , v18 , v21 , v23 , v24 , v31 , v34 , v35 , v37 , v41 }
and
D49 = {v2 , v5 , v6 , v8 , v13 , v16 , v19 , v20 , v26 , v27 , v30 , v33 , v38 , v40 , v41 , v42 , v48 }.
It is easy to verify that D37 , D43 and D49 are 4-locating–dominating codes in P37 , P43 and P49 attaining the lower bound of
Theorem 1.2, respectively. Therefore, by Theorem 2.2, we also have the optimal 4-locating–dominating codes for the paths
P36 , P42 and P48 . By Theorem 3.2, we have M4LD (P44 ) ≥ 16. On the other hand, we have MrLD (P44 ) ≤ MrLD (P45 ) = 16.
Hence, M4LD (P44 ) = 16.
Now the only open values are M4LD (P38 ) and M4LD (P50 ). By the previous constructions, we know that M4LD (P38 ) ≤
M4LD (P39 ) = 14 and M4LD (P50 ) ≤ M4LD (P51 ) = 18. By an exhaustive computer search, we have been able to prove that
there are no 4-locating–dominating codes in P38 and P50 with 13 and 17 codewords, respectively. Hence, M4LD (P38 ) = 14
and M4LD (P50 ) = 18. In conclusion, all the values of M4LD (Pn ) are determined.
6. On the conjecture of even segment lengths
In this section, the focus is on the infinite path P∞ . Previously, we have considered the balls Br (vi ) = {vj ∈ V∞ | i − r ≤
j ≤ i + r }, i ∈ Z, of size (or length) 2r + 1, which is necessarily odd. In [1], also the case where a ball or rather a segment can
have an even length is considered in P∞ . Clearly, the ‘center’ of the segment of even size is not a vertex of V∞ , so we also
need to choose how to associate a segment with a codeword. Notice that this prevents the usual symmetry

vj ∈ Br (vi ) ⇔ vi ∈ Br (vj )
which we often used earlier. In what follows, we always associate a segment in the same way with every codeword.
The problem is stated analogously after selecting the association of a segment with a codeword: how to place the
codewords (segments) in P∞ in such a way that every vertex of V∞ , which is not in the code, belongs to at least one segment
and no two non-codewords belong to the same set of segments. Again, we would like to have as small density of a code as
possible. The density of a code C is defined as usually
|Qn ∩ C |
D(C ) = lim sup
|Qn |
n→∞
where Qn = {vi ∈ V∞ | −n ≤ i ≤ n}.
In [1], it is pointed out that the choice how to associate a segment with a codeword affects on the minimum density of a
locating–dominating code in P∞ . However, it is shown in Theorem 16 of [1] that no matter how one chooses the association
with a codeword, the smallest density is at least 1/3.
Related to this lower bound, the following conjecture is given in [1].
Conjecture 6.1. Let s be a positive integer divisible by 6. Then we can achieve the density 1/3 for a locating–dominating code
using segments of length s in P∞ .

1872

Fig. 3. The code C of Theorem 6.2 illustrated when k = 3. The code is formed by repeating the pattern in the dashed box infinitely many times to the left
and to the right.

In the next theorem we shall confirm this conjecture.
Theorem 6.2. Let s be a positive integer divisible by 6. There exists a code C ⊆ V∞ and an assignment of a segment of length s
with a codeword such that C is locating–dominating in P∞ with density 1/3.
Proof. Let s be a positive integer with s = 6k and k ≥ 1. Denote S = {0, 1, 2, . . . , 3k − 2, 6k − 1}. Take
C = {vi ∈ V∞ | i ≡ x mod 9k for some x ∈ S }.
In Fig. 3, the code C is illustrated when k = 3. Let us associate, for all the codewords vc ∈ C , the segment as follows: 
Bs (vc ) =

B6k (vc ) = {vc −3k+1 , . . . , vc , . . . , vc +3k }. Clearly, the density of the code is 1/3. Next we show that C is locating–dominating
in P∞ by determining any vertex vi ∈ V∞ \ C with the aid of the segments of codewords it belongs to.
First of all, every non-codeword vi belongs to some segment, namely to a segment associated with vc1 ∈ C for some
c1 ≡ 3k − 2(mod 9k) or with vc2 ∈ C for some c2 ≡ 6k − 1(mod 9k).
Suppose first that there exists a codeword vc ∈ C such that c ≡ 6k − 1(mod 9k) with vi ∈ 
Bs (vc ). If there is no other
codeword to whose segment vi belongs, then vi = vc +1 . Assume then that we have at least one codeword vc ′ for which c ′ > c
and to whose segment vi belongs. Let c1 = max{a ∈ Z | vi ∈ 
Bs (va ), va ∈ C }. Consequently, vi = vc1 −3k+1 . Suppose now
Bs (va ), va ∈ C }.
that we do not have codewords with larger index c ′ than c for which vi ∈ 
Bs (vc ′ ). Let c2 = min{a ∈ Z | vi ∈ 
Then vi = vc2 +3k .
Suppose finally that none of the codewords vc such that vi ∈ 
Bs (vc ) satisfies c ≡ 6k − 1(mod 9k). Now vi = vc2 +3k−1
where again c2 = min{a ∈ Z | vi ∈ 
Bs (va ), va ∈ C }. This completes the proof.
Locating–dominating codes achieving the density 1/3 for the even segment lengths satisfying s ̸≡ 0(mod 6), can be
found in [1].
7. Conclusions
Previously, the exact values of M1LD (Pn ) and M2LD (Pn ) are known due to [15] and [8], respectively. In Section 5, we
computed the exact values of M3LD (Pn ) and M4LD (Pn ). In Section 3, the exact values of MrLD (Pn ) have been determined when
1 ≤ n ≤ 7r + 3. Furthermore, by Theorem 4.5, we have that MrLD (Pn ) = ⌈(n + 1)/3⌉ when n ≥ 3r + 2 + 6r ((r − 3)(2r + 1)+ r ).
In conclusion, although some of the exact values of MrLD (Pn ) are known when 7r + 3 < n < 3r + 2 + 6r ((r − 3)(2r + 1) + r ),
the question remains open in general.

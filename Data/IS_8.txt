Introduction

In recent years, the rapid growth of multimedia technology
has greatly facilitated the transmission and distribution of
digital contents over the internet. As a result, the protection of
the intellectual property rights of digital media has become an
important issue. Digital watermarking has been used extensively for digital right management of multimedia data. It is a
process of embedding watermark into the multimedia data to
show authenticity and ownership. It has various applications
such as copyright protection, data authentication, privacy
protection, fingerprinting, broadcast monitoring, and so on. It
must successfully satisfy the trade-off among the conflicting
requirements of imperceptibility, robustness, and data
payload.
A comprehensive survey on watermarking can be found in
Cox and Miller (2002) and Cvejic and Seppanen (2007). Most of

the watermarking algorithms proposed over the last few years
mainly focus on image and video watermarking (Agresteand
and Andaloro, 2008; Tsolis et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2005;
Noorkami and Mersereau, 2008). Audio watermarking is
more challenging than image and video watermarking,
because the human auditory system (HAS) is significantly
more sensitive than the human visual system (HVS). Most
audio watermarking methods utilize either a time domain
(Swanson et al., 1998; Lie and Chang, 2006) or a transform
domain such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT) (Chen et al.,
2013, 2010a, 2010b), lifting wavelet transform (LWT) (Erc¸elebi
and Batakc¸ı, 2009), and fast Fourier transform (FFT) (Megı´as
et al., 2010). Time domain methods are very efficient and
easy to implement, however, transform domain methods can
provide high robustness. Swanson et al. (Swanson et al., 1998)
proposed a watermarking scheme that embeds watermark
bits by modifying the audio samples directly. Lie and Chang
(Lie and Chang, 2006) introduced a method in which group

amplitudes are modified to achieve high robustness. However,
both methods have low data payload. In Chen et al. (2013),
authors presented an adaptive method using wavelet based
entropy, but robustness to resampling and low-pass filtering
attacks are quite low. Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2010a) proposed
an algorithm that embeds watermark information by energyproportion scheme. However, the SNR results of this algorithm are not satisfactory. In Chen et al. (2010b), authors
introduced an optimization-based watermarking scheme
which embeds watermark in the lowest-frequency coefficients of DWT. However, the subjective evaluation of
watermarked audio signals has not been conducted in this
scheme. Erc¸elebi and Batakc¸ı (2009) proposed a watermarking
method based on LWT in which a binary image is embedded
as watermark. However, from the reported result, robustness
to attacks of this method is quite low. Megı´as et al. (2010)
suggested a watermarking method that embeds watermark
in FFT domain, but it has low data payload. Recently, the
singular value decomposition (SVD) has been used as an
effective technique in digital watermarking (El-Samie, 2009;
Al-Nuaimy et al., 2011; Ali and Ahmad, 2010; Bhat et al.,
2010; Lei et al., 2011). El-Samie (2009) and Al-Nuaimy et al.
(2011) proposed an efficient SVD based audio watermarking
algorithm which is domain adaptive. Moreover, the proposed
segment-by-segment approach enhanced the detectability
compared to the simple approach utilizing the whole original
audio signal directly. However, the detection scheme is nonblind and robustness needs further improvement. In Ali and
Ahmad (2010), authors proposed a method based on DWT
and SVD. But this method is also non-blind and has low data
payload. The most recent SVD based blind audio watermarking methods are proposed by Bhat et al. (2010) and Lei
et al. (2011). These methods provide high robustness; however the data payload of these methods is quite low. Moreover,
some other techniques such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD) (Khaldi and Boudraa, 2013), time spread (TS) echo
method (Xiang et al., 2011; Erfani and Siahpoush, 2009), and
audio histogram technique (Xiang and Huang, 2007; Xiang
et al., 2008) are becoming popular in audio watermarking
field. The main limitation of the existing audio watermarking
techniques is the difficulty to obtain a favorable trade-off
among imperceptibility, robustness, and data payload. To
overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a blind
SVD-based audio watermarking scheme in DCT domain using
entropy and log-polar transformation (LPT). The main features of the proposed scheme include (i) it utilizes the entropy,
DCT, SVD, LPT, and quantization jointly, (ii) it uses a tent map
which contains the chaotic characteristic to enhance the
confidentiality of the proposed scheme, (iii) watermark is
embedded by quantizing the Cartesian component of highest
singular value obtained from the DCT sub band with highest
entropy value, (iv) watermark extraction process is blind, and
(v) it achieves a good trade-off among imperceptibility,
robustness, and data payload. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme shows high
robustness against various attacks such as noise addition,
cropping, resampling, requantization, signal addition, signal
subtraction, and MP3 compression. Moreover, it outperforms
state-of-the-art methods (Chen et al., 2013, 2010a; Erc¸elebi and
Batakc¸ı, 2009; Al-Nuaimy et al., 2011; Ali and Ahmad, 2010;

Bhat et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2011; Khaldi and Boudraa, 2013;
Xiang et al., 2011; Erfani and Siahpoush, 2009; Xiang and
Huang, 2007; Xiang et al., 2008) in terms of imperceptibility,
robustness, and data payload. This is because watermark bits
are embedded into the Cartesian components of the largest
singular value obtained from the DCT sub band with highest
entropy value of each frame. The data payload of the proposed
scheme is 172.39 bps which is relatively higher than that of the
state-of-the-art methods.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
provides background information including DCT, SVD, and
LPT. Section 3 introduces our proposed watermarking
scheme. Section 4 compares the proposed scheme with the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of imperceptibility and
robustness. Section 5 provides performance analysis of the
proposed scheme. Lastly, the conclusion of this paper is presented in Section 6.

Background information

2.1.

Discrete cosine transform

The DCT is widely used in signal and image processing, especially for lossy data compression. It expresses the sequence
of many data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions
oscillating at different frequencies. It can be written as.

(2)

The DCT has a strong ‘energy compaction’ property, i.e.,
most of the signal information tend to be concentrated in a
few low-frequency components of the DCT coefficients. This
property can be utilized in audio watermarking to reduce the
deterioration of watermarked signal.

2.2.

Singular value decomposition

Let H ¼ {Hij}pÂp be an arbitrary matrix with SVD of the form
H ¼ USVT, where U and V are orthogonal p Â p matrices and S is
a p Â p diagonal matrix with non negative elements. The diagonal entries of S are called the singular values (SVs) of H
where S ¼ diag (s1, s2, … sp), the columns of U are called the left
singular vectors of H, and the columns of V are called the right
singular vectors of H.

2.3.

Log-polar transformation

The LPT is a conformal transformation from the Cartesian
coordinate system to the log-polar coordinate system.
Consider the log-polar coordinate system (r, q), where r
denotes the logarithm of the distance between a given point

and the origin and q denotes the angle between a line of
reference and the line through the origin and the point. The
transformation from the Cartesian coordinate to the log-polar
coordinate is given by the following equation:
r ¼ log

where (x, y) is a point in Cartesian coordinate system. The
transformation from the log-polar coordinate to the Cartesian
coordinate is given by the following equation:
x ¼ er cos q; y ¼ er sin q

where T is a predefined threshold. The binary watermark
image W is converted into a one dimensional sequence q,
where q ¼ {q(i), i ¼ 1, 2, 3, … , M Â M}. Finally q(i) is encrypted
using z(i) by the following rule:
uðiÞ ¼ zðiÞ4qðiÞ;

MÂM

(7)

where u(i) is the encrypted watermark sequence and 4 is the
exclusive-or (XOR) operation. Here, y(1) and b are used as secret key K.

3.2.

Watermark embedding process

Let A ¼ {a(n), 1
n
L} be an original audio signal with L
samples, W ¼ {w(k, l), 1 k M, 1 l M } be a binary logo
image to be embedded into the original audio signal.

The proposed watermark embedding process is shown in
Fig. 1. The embedding process is implemented in the following
steps:

3.1.

1) The original audio signal A is first segmented into nonoverlapping frames F ¼ {F1, F2, F3,…, F(MÂM)/2} and then
each frame Fi is transformed into DCT domain to calculate
the DCT coefficients Ci, where i indicates the frame
number.

Watermark preprocesing

In this paper, we use a tent map that contains the chaotic
characteristics to encrypt the binary watermark image for
enhancing the confidentiality of the proposed method. Tent
map can be defined as follows:

where y(1)2(0,1) and b are a real parameter (map's initial
condition). Then a binary sequence z(i) is calculated by using
the following equation:

2) The first l (low frequency) DCT coefficients of each frame Fi
are divided into m number of sub bands B ¼ {Bj, 1 j m}
with r numbers of coefficients in each sub band Bj, where j
indicates the sub band number.

3) The entropy E ¼ {Ej, 1

where Ei represents the entropy value of the sub band Bi, pk
and k are the amplitude of the DCT coefficients and the index
of the DCT coefficients, respectively in each sub band Bj.

Six ¼ eSi cos q
Siy ¼ eSi sin q

(10)

where q is the angle of decomposition.
4) Find Emax ¼ max{E1, E2, E3,…, Em} of the sub band {B1, B2,
B3,…, Bm} of each frame Fi, where max operation returns the
largest element in {E1, E2, E3,…, Em}. Thus, Emax represents
the largest entropy value in {E1, E2, E3,…, Em}.

9) Let Dix ¼ round (Six/Q) and Diy ¼ round (Siy/Q), where Q is a
predefined quantization coefficient. Calculate Deix and Deiy
by using the following equation:
&

5) Select Emax and find the corresponding sub band from {B1,
B2, B3,…, Bm} i.e., the sub band with largest entropy value
(denoted by Bj(largest)) of the DCT coefficients of each frame
Fi. This sub band is selected because it is the significant
band to embed watermark data. Fig. 2 shows the illustration of entropy method.
6) The DCT coefficients of Bj(largest) of each frame Fi are rearranged into an N Â N square matrix Ri. This is done by
dividing the coefficient set into N segments with N
coefficients.
7) SVD is performed to decompose each matrix Ri into three
matrices: Ui, Si, and Vi. The SVD operation is represented as
follows:
Ri ¼ Ui Si ViT

(9)

8) The largest singular value Si (1,1) of each matrix Si is
selected. Watermark information should be embedded into
the most significant perceptual components of the audio
signal in order to guarantee the robustness and imperceptibility of the proposed method. As Si (1,1) contains the
most power of the signal, therefore, it represents the
significant perceptual component of the audio signal.
The Si (1,1) of each matrix Si is further decomposed into two

(11)

Here, both Deix and Deiy are even numbers.
10) In order to guarantee the robustness and transparency, the
proposed scheme embeds watermark bit into Deix and Deiy of
each matrix Si using quantization. This ensures that the
watermark is located at the most significant perceptual
components of the audio signal. Watermark data is
embedded by using the following equation:

11) The modified components S'ix and S'iy of each matrix S'i are
calculated using the following equation:
S'ix ¼ QD'ix
S'iy ¼ QD'iy

(13)

12) The modified largest singular value S'i (1,1) is calculated
using the following Cartesian-to-log-polar transformation:

13) Reinsert each modified largest singular value S'i (1,1) into
matrix Si and inverse SVD is applied to obtain the modified
matrix R'i which is given by
R0i ¼ Ui S0i ViT

(15)

Each matrix R'i is then reshaped to create the modified sub
band B'jðlargestÞ of each frame Fi by performing the inverse
operation of step 6.

Fig. 2 e Illustration of entropy method.

14) After substituting the modified sub band B'jðlargestÞ for
Bj(largest), an inverse DCT is performed on C'i to obtain the
watermarked audio frame F'i .

15) Finally, all watermarked frames are concatenated to
calculate the watermarked audio signal A'.

Watermark detection process

The proposed watermark detection process is shown in Fig. 3.
The detection process is blind and described in the following
steps:
1) The DCT is performed on each frame F*i of the attacked
watermarked audio signal.
2) Calculate the entropy of each sub band B*j of each frame.
Rearrange each B*j(largest) to obtain R*i .
3) SVD is performed on each R*i to calculate the largest value
S*i (1,1) of each matrix S*i of the attacked watermarked audio
frame.
4) The S*i (1,1) of each matrix Si is further decomposed into two
components S*ix and S*iy using the following log-polar-toCartesian transformation:

*
S*ix ¼ esi cos q
*
S*iy ¼ esi sin q

(16)

5) Calculate D*ix and D*iy of each highest singular value S*i (1, 1).
6) Watermark sequence is extracted as follows:



8) Finally, watermark image is obtained by rearranging the
binary sequence q*(i) into a square matrix W* of size M Â M.

Simulation results and discussion

In this section, several experiments were conducted on four
different types of 16 bit mono audio signals (Jazz, Blues, Folk,
and Classical) sampled at 44.1 kHz to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in terms of imperceptibility
and robustness. Each audio file contains 262,144 samples
(duration 5.94 s). Each audio signal is divided into frames of
size 512 samples. In each frame of audio signal, we embed two
bit watermark information of a binary logo image. In our
proposed method any binary logo image can be used as a
watermark. The imperceptibility and robustness results of the
proposed watermarking method will not be affected significantly by the frequency component of any binary watermark
image. This is because frequency components of the binary
image are not embedded as a watermark in the proposed
method; rather than a binary sequence (obtained by converting the binary image into one dimensional sequence) is
embedded as a watermark. As the watermark images are
different from each other, therefore, the performance of the
proposed method may vary slightly depending on the watermark image. A binary logo image and the corresponding
encrypted
image
by
chaotic
encryption
of
size
M Â M ¼ 32 Â 32 ¼ 1024 are shown in Fig. 4. Here, the selected
value for y(1), b, T, B, q, Q, the sub band number m and the
coefficients in each sub band r are 0.6, 0.3, 0.5, 2, 45 , 0.4, 3, and
9, respectively. These parameters have been selected in order
to have a good compromise among the conflicting requirements of imperceptibility, robustness, and data payload.

4.1.

Imperceptibility test

The imperceptibility of the watermarked audio signal is
evaluated by using two ways: (i) subjective listening test (ii)
objective test.

4.1.1.

Subjective listening test

An informal subjective listening test was performed to evaluate the perceptual quality of the watermarked audio. Ten

listeners were involved in this listening test and were asked to
classify the differences between them, using a five point
subjective difference grade (SDG) ranges from 5.0 to 1.0
(imperceptible to very annoying) as shown in Table 1. The
average SDG (i.e., mean opinion) scores for different watermarked sounds using the proposed scheme are shown in
Table 2. From the test results, we observed that the average
mean opinion score (MOS) of all watermarked sound using the
proposed scheme is 4.85, indicating that original and watermarked audio signals are perceptually similar.
Subjective evaluation was also carried out using ABX
double blind test. In this test, ten subjects were participated
whose hearing ability is normal. Initially, the original audio
signal (A) and the watermarked audio signal (B) are played to
each subject and then a third audio signal (X) is played in
random order, which can be either A or B. The subjects were
asked to verify whether X is A or B. One time of identification
was assumed as one trial and five times of trials were carried
out by each subject. A high percentage of correct detection
clearly indicates the perceptibility of the watermark in the
audio signal, whereas a detection percentage of 50% suggests
that the difference between original and watermarked sounds
was imperceptible. Table 2 shows the evaluation results of all
subjects in terms of percentage of correct detection. From this
table it is seen that correct detection scores range from 44% to
54%, indicating that proposed watermarking scheme provides
good imperceptible watermarked sound.

imperceptible when SNR is over 20 dB. After embedding
watermark information, the SNRs of the watermarked audio
signals using the proposed scheme are above 20 dB, shown in
Table 3, which satisfied the IFPI standard.
Fig. 5 shows the time domain representation of the original
audio signal with a watermarked audio signal in which the
watermark is imperceptible using the proposed scheme for
the signal ‘Jazz’.
The proposed scheme was compared with the several
recent methods in terms of SNR and MOS. This comparison is
based on the reported results in Chen et al. (2013, 2010a), AlNuaimy et al. (2011), Ali and Ahmad (2010), Bhat et al. (2010),
Lei et al. (2011), Khaldi and Boudraa (2013) and Erfani and
Siahpoush (2009) as shown in Table 4. From the comparison
results, it is seen that our proposed scheme outperforms the
recent watermarking methods in terms of SNR and MOS,
indicating a high transparency of the watermarked audio
signals.

Objective test

Objective test was conducted using the objective difference
grade (ODG) which is one of the output values obtained from
the perceptual evaluation of audio quality (PEAQ) measurement technique specified in ITU-R BS.1387 (International
Telecommunication Union-Radio-communication Sector)
standard (Thiede et al., 2000). It corresponds to the subjective
grade used in human based audio tests. The ODG ranges from
0.0 to À4.0 (imperceptible to very annoying) as shown in Table
1. Table 3 shows the objective quality of the watermarked
audio signals in terms of ODG. We observed that the average
ODG value is À0.29, indicating that original and watermarked
audio signals are perceptually indistinguishable.
Objective evaluation was also done by calculating the SNR
which is given by.

7. MP3 compression: MPEG-1 layer 3 compression was
applied. The watermarked audio signal was compressed at
a bit rate of 128 kbps and then decompressed back to the
wave format.

The following signal processing attacks were performed to
assess the robustness of the proposed scheme.
1. Noise addition: Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) was
added to the watermarked audio signal.
2. Cropping: 1000 samples were removed from the front,
middle, and end parts of the watermarked signal and then
these samples were replaced by the watermarked samples
attacked with AWGN.
3. Resampling: The watermarked signal originally sampled at
44.1 kHz was resampled at 22.050 kHz and then restored by
sampling again at 44.1 kHz.
4. Requantization: The 16 bit watermarked audio signal was
quantized down to 8 bits/sample and again requantized
back to 16 bits/sample.
5. Signal addition: 1000 samples of each audio signal were
added to the beginning of the corresponding watermarked
audio signal.
6. Signal subtraction: 1000 samples of each audio signal were
subtracted from the beginning of the corresponding
watermarked audio signal.

It is very important to select the significant sub band from
the DCT coefficients for embedding watermark. Entropy
method can select the optimal sub band from the different sub
bands of DCT coefficients. In this experiment, first twenty
seven low frequency DCT coefficients (l ¼ 27) are selected
which are divided into three sub bands (m ¼ 3) with nine DCT
coefficients (r ¼ 9) in each sub band. 1st nine DCT coefficients
belong to 1st sub band, next nine DCT coefficients belong to
2nd sub band, and last nine DCT coefficients belong to 3rd sub
band. Entropy method can select one sub band from these
three sub bands for each frame. In this study, we investigated
on embedding watermark bits into the Cartesian components
of the largest singular value obtained from different DCT sub
band and also the sub band with highest entropy value. Then,
we calculated the NC values of the proposed scheme against
different attacks and the results are shown in Fig. 6 for the
audio signal “Jazz” where 1st band, 2nd band, 3rd band, and
entropy represent embedding watermark bits into 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd DCT sub band and the sub band with largest entropy
value, respectively of each frame. We observed that embedding watermark bits into DCT sub band with largest entropy
value provides better robustness than embedding watermark
bits into different DCT sub bands. In this situation entropy
method can work better than the DCT sub bands. This is
because highest entropy value indicates the optimal DCT sub
band for embedding watermark.
Table 5 shows the NC and BER results of the proposed
scheme against different attacks for the audio signal ‘Jazz’.
The minimum NC and the maximum BER are 0.9726 and
3.3203, respectively. The extracted watermark images are
visually similar to the original watermark. These results verify
the good performance of the proposed scheme against various
attacks.
Table 6 shows similar results for the audio signal ‘Blues’,
‘Folk’, and ‘Classical’, respectively. We observed that the NC
values are all above 0.96 and the BER values are all below 4%,
demonstrating the high robustness of our proposed scheme

Performance analysis

5.1.

Error analysis

Two types of error may occur while searching the watermark
sequence: (1) false positive error (FPE) (2) false negative error
(FNE). These errors are very harmful because they impair the

is the binomial coefficient, U is the BER probability
g

of the extracted watermark, f and g are the total number of
watermark bits and matching bits, respectively (Bhat et al.,
2010). The approximate value of U can be obtained from BER
under different attacks. From Tables 4 and 5, we observed that
all BER values are less than 0.04. Thus U is taken as 0.96. By
substituting the value of f and U, (22) and (23) give
PFPE ¼ 2.62 Â 10À88 and PFNE ¼ 1.36Â10À80, respectively. Fig. 7
and Fig. 8 show the FPE and FNE probability for f 2 (0.100],
respectively, which indicates that PFPE and PFNE approaches
0 when f is larger than 30.

5.2.

Security analysis

Robustness against attack is very important for a secured
watermarking scheme. The proposed method utilizes chaotic
encryption to enhance the security. Since the proposed

watermark embedding and detection processes depend on the
secret key K and the quantization parameters, thus it is
impossible to detect the embedded watermark from the
watermarked audio signal without this information.

5.3.

Data payload

The data payload of a watermarking scheme refers to the
number of bits that are embedded into the original audio
signal within a unit of time and is measured by bits per second
(bps). Usually, the data payload for any watermarking method
should be more than 20 bps (Bhat et al., 2010). The data
payload of the proposed scheme is 172.39 bps.

Algorithm comparison and discussion

To establish the proposed method as a good watermarking
method, it is necessary to compare the performance of the
proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. Due to the
diversity of watermark embedding and detection processes, a
general comparison between the proposed scheme and the
several recent methods sorted by data payload is given in
Table 7, which is based on the reported result in the references
(Chen et al., 2013, 2010a; Erc¸elebi and Batakc¸ı, 2009; Bhat et al.,
2010; Lei et al., 2011; Khaldi and Boudraa, 2013; Xiang et al.,
2011; Erfani and Siahpoush, 2009; Xiang and Huang, 2007;
Xiang et al., 2008). Moreover, resampling, requantization,
and MP3 compression are compared in Table 7. The state-ofthe-art methods utilized different kinds of sounds of
different durations in their simulation. In addition, the
embedding and detection processes of each method were
different from each other. Moreover, different methods were
used different kinds of parameters. These methods experimentally found the optimal value for various parameters of
their methods. From these comparison results, it is seen that
the proposed scheme provides higher data payload and lower
BER values against several attacks compared with the recent
watermarking methods.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a blind SVD-based audio watermarking scheme in DCT domain using entropy, LPT, and
quantization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is highly robust against different attacks such
as noise addition, cropping, resampling, requantization,
signal addition, signal subtraction, and MP3 compression. In
addition, it provides high quality watermarked audio signal
and it has low error probability rates. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art audio watermarking methods in
terms of robustness, imperceptibility, and data payload. These
results indicate that the proposed watermarking scheme can
be used for copyright protection of audio signal.
There are several directions for future work on the proposed scheme introduced in this paper. In future, synchronization code (Megı´as et al., 2010) and error correcting codes
(Baudry et al., 2001) will be incorporated to improve the performance of the proposed scheme. In addition, computational
complexity of the proposed scheme will be assessed.

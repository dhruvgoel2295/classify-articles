Video broadcasting is an efﬁcient way to deliver video content to multiple receivers. However, due to heterogeneous channel conditions in MIMO wireless networks, it is challenging for video broadcasting to map scalable video layers to proper MIMO transmit antennas
to minimize the average overall video transmission distortion. In this paper, we investigate
the channel scheduling problem for broadcasting scalable video content over MIMO wireless networks. An adaptive channel scheduling based unequal error protection (UEP) video
broadcasting scheme is proposed. In the scheme, video layers are protected unequally by
being mapped to appropriate antennas, and the average overall distortion of all receivers
is minimized. We formulate this scheme into a non-linear combinatorial optimization
problem. It is not practical to solve the problem by an exhaustive search method with
heavy computational complexity. Instead, an efﬁcient branch-and-bound based channel
scheduling algorithm, named TBCS, is developed. TBCS ﬁnds the global optimal solution
with much lower complexity. The complexity is further reduced by relaxing the termination condition of TBCS, which produces a (1 À e)-optimal solution. Experimental results
demonstrate both the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our proposed scheme and algorithm.
As compared with some existing channel scheduling methods, TBCS improves the quality
of video broadcasting across all receivers signiﬁcantly.

1. Introduction
The broadcast nature of wireless medium allows a single source to simultaneously communicate information
with multiple receivers. However, one major challenge
for wireless broadcasting arises from heterogeneous network conditions of different receivers. Moreover, the
potentially low bandwidth and high bit error rate also become signiﬁcant obstacles for wireless communication
providers to offer high quality multimedia services. To

overcome such obstacles, multi-input multi-output
(MIMO) systems, which have been investigated to simultaneously transmit multiple bit streams to achieve high data
rate wireless multimedia communication [1], have
emerged as one of the most prominent techniques. MIMO
channel can be decomposed into a series of independent
SISO subchannels [2], and it is suitable for transmitting
multiple video substreams simultaneously. Meanwhile,
the technology of scalable video coding (SVC) [3,4] enables
media providers to generate a single embedded bitstream,
from which appropriate subsets can be extracted to meet
various requirements of a broad range of users. These conditions inspire us to combine the advanced MIMO and SVC
techniques to improve the video broadcasting performance. SVC video consists of layers with different contribution to video quality, which makes it possible be
transmitted with unequal error protection (UEP) [5–7]. In
MIMO unicast, UEP can be easily achieved by mapping

video layers to antennas in the order of antenna’s signal to
noise ratio (SNR) strength [6]. However, it is not trivial for
video broadcasting over MIMO wireless networks, and this
has not drawn enough research attention.
Adaptive channel scheduling, which denotes mapping
video layers to proper antennas to improve video transmission performance, faces great challenges for scalable video
broadcasting over MIMO wireless networks. It mainly
arises from that each transmit antenna corresponds to multiple receivers with different and independent SNR
strength, and the corresponding SNR strength for each
transmit antenna among multiple receivers forms a vector.
For example, in Fig. 1, antenna At1 is corresponding to three
receivers (At1 À User1, At1 À User2, At1 À User3), whose SNR
strength form the vector Ç1 = [c11, c12, c13]. It is the same for
antenna At2. since sets of vectors cannot be sorted, UEP cannot be achieved by mapping video layers to antennas in the
order of antenna’s SNR strength as done in MIMO unicast.
Besides, the inter-layer dependencies among SVC video layers further make the problem challenging.
In this paper, we have studied this problem and proposed a novel adaptive channel scheduling based scalable
video broadcasting scheme, which greatly improve the received video quality. By mapping each video layer to certain transmit antenna, the video layers are protected
unequally and the overall average video quality is improved. Since each antenna faces multiple users with various network conditions as Fig. 1 shows, and there exists
inter-layer dependencies among SVC video layers, the
channel scheduling problem is a non-linear combinatorial
problem. It can be solved using an exhaustive search
method, which has the highest accuracy level and computational complexity. In order to reduce the complexity
and make it suitable for practical implementation, a
branch-and-bound framework is adopted to ﬁnd an adaptive channel scheduling algorithm. Speciﬁcally, by partitioning the original problem into some simple subproblems, we are able to derive the upper and lower
bounds of the average overall video distortion. Then an
efﬁcient branch-and-bound based channel scheduling
algorithm (TBCS) is presented by incorporating these
bounds into the branch-and-bound framework. With

bounding and pruning techniques, TBCS ﬁnds the global
optimal solution with much lower complexity than the
exhaustive search method. Moreover, by relaxing termination conditions of TBCS, the complexity is further reduced and a (1 À e)-optimal solution is produced.
Through simulations, TBCS is shown to be effective and
efﬁcient. As compared with existing channel scheduling
schemes, the simulation results reveal signiﬁcant performance improvements in TBCS.
The main contributions of our work are summarized as:
 We are among the ﬁrst to investigate the channel
scheduling problem for salable video broadcasting over
MIMO wireless networks where video layers are broadcasted to all users simultaneously over multiple antennas. Different from traditional multiuser problem over
MIMO broadcast channel where different information
is conveyed to different users by multiple transmit
antennas, the antennas are shared by all users who
receive all streams broadcasted over the antennas in
our proposed scheme.
 We formulate it into a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem, and an efﬁcient channel scheduling
algorithm is proposed by employing the branch-andbound framework. Speciﬁcally, by mapping the video
layers to antennas according to the order of antennas’
average PER, we derive the upper bound of the average
overall video transmission distortion. On the other
hand, we transform the channel scheduling problem
to an assignment problem by relaxing some constraints,
and then the lower bound of the average overall video
transmission distortion is derived.
 By relaxing the termination condition of TBCS, a (1 À e)optimal solution is produced to balance the needs for
the complexity and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
This paper is organized as follows. We review related
work in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe our proposed
system and formulate the proposed scheme into a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem. In Section 4, we
propose a branch-and-bound framework to solve the channel scheduling problem. First, we derive the upper bound
(Section 4.2) and and lower bound (Section 4.3) of the
average overall distortion respectively, then an efﬁcient
branch-and-bound based channel scheduling algorithm is
proposed, which produces the global optimal solution
(Section 4.4). Also, an acceleration mechanism is presented
to further reduce the computational complexity (Section 4.5). We show simulation results in Section 5, and conclude the paper in Section 6.

In recent years, MIMO systems have emerged as one of
the most prominent techniques [1,8–10] to provide high
data rate wireless communications. Spatial multiplexing
techniques [1,10] have been investigated to simultaneously
transmit independent data in order to achieve high data
rate wireless multimedia communications. For MIMO
broadcast, the capacity region is still an open issue since
broadcast channels are non-degraded generally. But the

C. Zhou et al. / Computer Networks 57 (2013) 3039–3050

optimal sum rate, and the suggestive pre-coding scheme
are now completely known. Caire and Shamai [11] are the
ﬁrst to give the optimal sum capacity of MIMO broadcast
channel by explicitly maximizing the Dirty Paper [12] lower bound and minimizing the Sato’s upper bound [13] in the
case which, as it turns out, is equal. But its computational
complexity is high and it is hard to be extended to more
general cases [14]. Yang [15] extends the channel scheduling scheme from unicast MIMO network to multicast MIMO
network. In [16], dynamic resource allocation is studied to
maximize system’s capacity, and a low complexity suboptimal algorithm is proposed for practical implementation.
Literature [17] investigates multi-resolution broadcast systems for WCDMA cellular mobile networks, including
MIMO technology. However, all of these previous works focus on maximizing system’s capacity and belong to parallel
transmission (PT) [18] MIMO. In PT MIMO, all the content is
treated equally and it is not suitable for video communication, since video content generally contains bits with different importance, and needs to be protected unequally when
transmitted over error-prone wireless networks. In unicast,
UEP in MIMO can be easily achieved by mapping video layers to multiple transmit antennas in the order of antenna’s
signal to noise ratio (SNR) strength [6]. While in MIMO
broadcast networks, it becomes challenging. This is mainly
because that each transmit antenna corresponds to multiple end users, and the SNR strength of each transmit antenna forms a vector as Fig. 1 shows.
The idea of scalable video for multiuser communications is well-known. Without loss of generality, multiuser
MIMO is used to convey different information to different
users by multiple transmit antennas. In [19], the authors
propose a video broadcasting scheme via pre-coding and
SNR-Scalable video coding. By packet extraction and precoding, users will receive different quality of videos. There
are some other research works on multiuser MIMO [20–
22]. However, we differ from them in several major ways.
For the purpose of clarity, we take [19] as example to compare our proposed scheme with these works. First, by the
pre-coding matrix which is consist of some orthogonal
sub-matrices, the antennas are divided into some independent groups and each user will only receive the stream
transmitted by a certain group of antennas in [19]. In our
proposed scheme, each user will receive the streams transmitted over all antennas. Therefore, this kind of multiuser
video transmission schemes have great limitation in the
number of users that the number of transmit antennas is
no smaller than the sum of all users receive antennas as assumed in [19]. We have no such limitation on both the
number of users and number of antennas since all users
multiplex the same transmit antennas. At last, in [19],
some streams are transmitted multiple times at the transmitter side which wastes bandwidth and power resource,
for example, the base layer must transmitted in each group
of antennas for each user. While in our proposed scheme,
each video layer is only mapped to a certain antenna and
broadcasted to all users.
Very few UEP schemes have been proposed for broadcasting scalable video over MIMO wireless networks where
multiple antennas have been sufﬁciently multiplexed for
broadcasting multiple streams to all users concurrently.

3041

In [23], UEP is achieved by using diversity embedded space
time codes (DESTC), which provides UEP to different video
layers, thereby delivering high quality video to users with
good network conditions while still providing acceptable
quality to users with poor network conditions. But the
authors assume that all receivers employ single receive antenna, which greatly simpliﬁes the problem. Moreover,
DESTC is not ﬂexible enough to adapt to the complex network environment because it add different amount of
redundancy to different streams without considering the
instantaneous channel conditions. A novel JSCC framework
for scalable video transmission has been proposed in [24],
in which power allocation, channel coding and modulation
are jointly optimized to achieve UEP and improve the system performance. The computational complexity is very
high and it is not suitable for practical implementation.
In [25], UEP is achieved for scalable video broadcasting
over cooperative wireless networks through power allocation. However, all of these previous works treat transmit
antennas equally and neglect their various qualities. In
fact, the qualities of transmit antennas are time-varying,
and video transmission performance can be greatly improved by mapping video layers to antennas properly.
To the best of our knowledge, none of previous research
work considers achieving UEP for scalable MIMO video
broadcasting through channel scheduling. In this paper,
we investigate this problem, and an adaptive channel
scheduling based video broadcasting scheme is proposed.
We formulate this scheme into a non-linear combinatorial
problem. By adopting the branch-and-bound framework,
an effective and efﬁcient low-complexity channel scheduling algorithm is proposed.
3. Problem formulation
In this section, the proposed system architecture is described at ﬁrst. Then we formulate the adaptive channel
scheduling based scalable video broadcasting scheme into
a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem.
3.1. System description
Fig. 2 shows the block diagram of our proposed system,
where all transmitter and receivers are equipped with
multiple antennas. Here we only show one receiver for
the purpose of clarity, and all receivers have the same signal processing diagrams. At the transmitter side, the input
video sequence is encoded to generate multiple video
layers by H.264/SVC [3,4]. Combining with the feedback

SNR strength and video layers’ unequal importance, the video layers are periodically switched among multiple transmit antennas using our proposed TBCS algorithm. Then the
video layers are broadcasted to all receivers simultaneously. At the receiver side, each receiver needs to estimate the post-processing SNR strength of each transmit
antenna and send it back to the transmitter by employing
pilot symbols [26]. The transmitted video sequences are
reconstructed after demodulation and channel decoding.
Without loss of generality, it is commonly assumed that
the channel is block fading [27], i.e., the channel remains
constant over some consecutive symbol periods (determined by the coherence time) and then changes in an independent fashion to a new realization. The above video
broadcasting system can be treated as K virtual MIMO unicast systems except that all receivers have the same transmitter, and K is the total number of receivers [28]. Then, for
each virtual MIMO system with Mt transmit antennas and
Mr receive antennas over ﬂat-fading channel, the system
equation between the transmitter and kth receiver is

sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Es
yk ¼
Hk x þ fk
Mt

ð1Þ

where Hk is the complex channel matrix between the transmitter and kth receiver with size Mr Â Mt,x is the Mt Â 1
transmitted signal vector, yk is the Mr Â 1 received signal vector at kth receiver, fk is the Mr Â 1 noise vector with elements
distributed according to CN ð0; N 0 Þ, and Es is the total average
energy available at the transmitter over a symbol period having removed losses due to propagation and shadowing.
The channel matrix Hk is estimated by existing estimation methods such as maximum-likelihood (ML) and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) techniques discussed
in [26] at kth (1 6 k 6 K) receiver. More details of channel
estimation can also refer to literature [6]. The transmitted
signals are detected by linear ZF (zero-forcing) receivers,
which are much more practically attractive than non-linear receivers due to their low complexity. Then, the postprocessing SNR strength of ith transmit antenna for kth receiver, cik, is obtained as

cik ¼

where [Á]ii denotes ith diagonal entry of the matrix inside
the square bracket, and HH denotes the Hermitian of H.
In this work, we focus on exploiting the potential UEP
ability of channel scheduling for scalable video broadcasting over MIMO system. To eliminate the effect of channel
coding and modulation, which can also achieve UEP, we
ﬁx the modulation level and channel coding rate for all video layers. In fact, our proposed channel scheduling method can be incorporated with these methods to further
improve the system performance, one of the incorporation
examples is our previous JSCC work [29]. Speciﬁcally, MQAM and RS (N, m) are used for modulation and channel
coding, where N is block size, and m is the number of
source bits in each block. Then, combining with the feedback SNR strength in Eq. (2), we can easily derive the block

erfc (Á) is the complementary error function.
3.2. Problem formulation
Suppose the transmitter is equipped with Mt antennas,
user k is equipped with Mkr antennas, and the video sequence is encoded into L layers. Generally, each video layer
is broadcasted over one transmit antenna or dropped at the
transmitter side due to the data-rate constraints. We deﬁne ALÂMt ¼ faij g as channel scheduling matrix to denote
the mapping relationship between video layers and transmit antennas, and its entries aij 2 {0, 1}. Let aij = 1 if ith video layer is transmitted over jth transmit antenna, or
aij = 0 otherwise. Then, we have

Then, we derive the video layer’s PER matrix PLÂK = {Pjk} as

where Pik denotes the ith video layer’s PER for user k, bik is

We employed the quality model proposed in [30] to
estimate the end-to-end video transmission distortion in
our work. According to [30], the video quality (PSNR) after
decoding all the ﬁrst n layers is given as

ð6Þ

where b1 and b2 are model parameters, the value of s depends on the frame type, and qn is the value of quantization
parameter (QP) for layer n. More details about this can refer to literature [30] and the references therein. Then, the
weight of each video layer is written as:

For the purpose of clarity, we omit the subscript of matrixes A and P in the following of the paper. Now, we get

Moreover, we can also get the video bit-rate for each video layer according to literature [30] and we denote ri as
the video bit-rate of layer i. Under the assumption that
RS (N, m) is used for channel coding, video layer i would
consume the data-rate of r0i for transmission with

We assume the data-rate capacity of antennas i is Ri.
Since a ﬁxed modulation order on all antennas is used,
we have R1 ¼ R2 ¼ Á Á Á ¼ RMt ¼ R. Then, the proposed adaptive channel scheduling based video broadcasting scheme

The above optimization problem aims to minimize the
average overall video transmission distortion through
adaptive channel scheduling, i.e., selecting the optimal matrix A⁄. However, due to the heterogeneous network conditions of different receivers and inter-layer dependencies
among SVC video layers, solving this problem is challenging. Exhaustive search method ﬁnds the optimal solution
by searching the whole solution space, whose size is M Lt .
Its computational complexity increases heavily with the
number of transmit antennas and video layers, and it is
not suitable for practical implementation.
4. Branch-and-bound based adaptive channel
scheduling
In this section, we adopt the branch-and-bound framework to solve above channel scheduling problem, and an
efﬁcient branch-and-bound based channel scheduling
algorithm is proposed. We ﬁrst brieﬂy describe how to
adopt the branch-and-bound framework into channel
scheduling. Then, the upper and lower bounds of the average overall distortion for each subproblem are derived in
detail. At last, we present TBCS to solve the optimization
problem in Eq. (11).
4.1. Branch-and-bound based channel scheduling
Branch-and-bound is an iterative method for solving
optimization problems, especially for discrete and combinatorial problems. A branch-and-bound procedure has
two components. The ﬁrst one, which is called branching,
is to partition a problem into subproblems. The procedure
is repeated recursively to each of the subproblems and all
produced subproblems naturally form a tree structure, i.e.,

3043

the branch-and-bound tree. Its nodes are the constructed
subproblems. The leaves of the tree are also call the Problem List. The other component is bounding, which is a fast
way of ﬁnding upper and lower bounds for the optimal
solution for each subproblem.
The core of this approach is an observation that, for a
minimization problem, if the lower bound for a subproblem s2 is higher than the upper bound for any other subproblem s1, s2 and the branch rooted at s2 can be safely
discarded from the tree, thus the computational complexity can be reduced. This procedure is called pruning. Besides, for each iterative, the subproblem with the
smallest lower bound is selected and further partitioned.
The algorithm terminates when the lower bound is equal
to the upper bound.
In our proposed adaptive channel scheduling based video broadcasting scheme, we partition the problem into
subproblems by selecting available transmit antennas for
the video layers orderly, i.e., we ﬁrst select a transmit antenna for the base layer, then for the ﬁrst enhancement
layer, and so on. When computing the upper and lower
bounds of the average distortion for the nodes in the dth
layer of the branch-and-bound tree, we only need to compute the bounds for the remaining L À d video layers. This
is because all the ﬁrst d video layers have been mapped to
certain antennas, and their corresponding distortion is
determined.
In order to reduce the iterations, pruning procedure is
used to discard nodes from the tree. The key of pruning is
to obtain the bounds for each node. For our proposed minimization problem, any feasible solution can be treated as
the upper bound. On the other hand, an lower bound is
found by solving a relaxed problem. The details of deriving
these bounds are presented in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3
respectively.
Before presenting how to derive the upper and lower
bounds, we present Proposition 1 as follows, which servers
as an intuition to develop the distortion bounds.
Proposition 1. In unicast, when the scalable video layers
are mapped to multiple transmit antennas according to the
order of PER (the base layer is transmitted over the antenna
with the smallest PER, the ﬁrst enhancement layer is
transmitted over the antenna with the second smallest PER,
and so on), the minimum video transmission distortion is
obtained.
The proof is given in Appendix A. h
4.2. Upper bound
The objective of above optimization problem is to minimize the average overall video transmission distortion by
selecting the optimal channel scheduling matrix A⁄. For
this proposed minimization problem, any matrix that satisﬁes the constraints described in Eq. (11) is a feasible solution, and its corresponding average overall distortion is an
upper bound. Though it is very easy to ﬁnd such matrixes,
it is not trivial to ﬁnd an appropriate matrix which obtains
a tight upper bound. This is very crucial for reducing the
number of iterations.

3044

C. Zhou et al. / Computer Networks 57 (2013) 3039–3050

In Proposition 1, we show that the optimal matrix A⁄
can be easily obtained according to the order of antenna’s
PER in MIMO unicast. The proposition also denotes that the
principle of channel scheduling is to map important video
layers to antennas with better channel quality (low PER).
MIMO broadcast channel is a vector channel, i.e., each
transmit antenna corresponds to multiple receivers, and
the corresponding PER forms a vector. Since sets of vectors
cannot be sorted, it is hard to determine which antenna
has the best or worst channel quality. In order to ﬁnd a feasible solution providing a tight upper bound, average PER
of each transmit antenna is adopted to denote its channel
quality in TBCS. Then, the channel scheduling problem is
similar to that in unicast. It is worth to noticing that more
than one video layers may be mapped to the same antenna
when the data-rate constraints are satisﬁed, thus we cannot simply map the video layers to transmit antennas in
the order of their average PER according to Proposition 1.
However, the intuition of mapping video layers to antennas behind Proposition 1 is that from the lowest layer to
the highest layer, we map video layer i to antenna j when
it has lowest average PER and its remaining available datarate is no smaller than the required rate r0i . Then, the
remaining available data-rate of antenna j is updated by
subtracting r 0i . This process is iterated until all video layers
have been mapped to appropriate antennas or there is no
antennas whose remaining available data-rate satisﬁes the
data-rate constraints. Though the solution is not optimal,
its performance is much better than random channel
scheduling, and a much tighter upper bound is obtained.
We denotes Pai v g as the average PER of ith antenna, then
we have

ð12Þ

For nodes in dth layer of the branch-and-bound tree,
each of the ﬁrst d(1 6 d 6 L) video layers has been mapped
to a certain transmit antenna respectively. This denotes
that the values aij(1 6 i 6 d, 1 6 j 6 Mt) have been determined as described in Section 4.1. Then for "d < i 6 L,
1 6 j 6 Mt, the value of aij is derived as follows:

(
aij ¼

1; if Paj v g ¼ minðWi Þ
0; otherwise

ð13Þ

where Wi is the set of antenna’s average PER, excluding the
antennas whose remaining available data À rate is no smaller than r 0i . Until now, we have obtained the values for all
entries in matrix A. According to formula Eqs. (2)–(9), the
upper bound Dupper of the average overall distortion can
be easily derived.
4.3. Lower bound
In order to obtain the lower bound of average overall
distortion, we ﬁrst deﬁne an efﬁciency matrix V = {vij} to
denote video layers’ distortion, and its entry vij denotes
ith video layer’s average distortion among all users when
it is mapped to jth transmit antenna. The entries are
dependent due to the inter-dependence among video layers. We derive approximate expression of lower bounds

for the entries in V, which have eliminated the dependence
among them. Then, the primal problem is transformed into
a standard assignment problem (AP), and the optimal solution (minimal total average distortion) of this AP is the primal problem’s lower bound.
Now, we give details of deriving the lower bound of
average overall distortion. For the nodes in dth layer of
the
branch-and-bound
tree,
the
values
aij(1 6 i 6 d, 1 6 j 6 Mt) have been determined as described in
the above section. Then we can easily derive Pik(1 6 i 6 d, 1 6 k 6 K) according to Eq. (5). Now the average
overall distortion of the ﬁrst d video layers is

Dd ¼

ð14Þ

Therefore, in order to obtain the lower bound of the
average overall distortion, we only need to derive the lower bound of average distortion for the remaining L À d video layers. According to the inter-dependence among
video layers, vij is written as

where for user k (1 6 k 6 K), Pik = bjk since ith video layer is
mapped to jth antenna, and Psk(1 6 s 6 d) are constant as
explained in the second paragraph of this sub-section.
Therefore, vij is only depending on Psk(d + 1 6 s 6 i À 1).
Now we can write Eq. (15) as

than r0i . When a layer is mapped to a certain antenna, its
remaining available data-rate is updated by the video
layer’s bit-rate including redundancy bit-rate. The intuition of this inequality comes from Proposition 1, and it is
derived by selecting the feasible antenna with smallest
PER for sth (d + 1 6 s 6 i À 1) video layer iteratively. Moreover, for any video layer i, when there is no antenna whose
remaining available data-rate is no smaller than r0i , or Wks;j is
a null set, it denotes video layer i must be dropped at the
transmitter side. In this case, we simply set v 0ij ¼ wi .
Since v 0ij is a lower bound of vij and it is independent
from each other, the efﬁciency matrix V0 for the assignment problem is written as:

4.4. Adaptive channel scheduling algorithm
We incorporate these bounds into the branch-andbound framework, and an efﬁcient branch-and-bound
based channel scheduling algorithm is proposed. Compared with exhaustive search method, TBCS ﬁnds the global optimal solution with much lower complexity.
Fig. 3 illustrates the convergence of TBCS as d increase.
For a certain selected node in the branch-and-bound tree, d
denotes both its layer-index in the tree and the number of
video layers that have been assigned antennas for this
node. The ﬁgure shows that when d = L, i.e., the selected
node is a leaf in the branch-and-bound tree, the upper bound
is equal to the lower bound and the algorithm terminates.
The pseudo code for the branch-and-bound based channel
scheduling algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. The algorithm consists of three major components: (i) Partition
component partitions the primal problem into subproblems, (ii) Bounding component derives the upper and lower bounds of each subproblem, (iii) Iteration and Pruning
component compares the bounds and delete some subproblems to reduce the complexity.
Moreover, we accelerate the convergence of TBCS and
further reduce the complexity by relaxing its termination
condition. The algorithm terminates when the upper bound
reaches 1 + e of the lower bound, i.e., UB À LB = LB Ã e, and a
(1 À e)-optimal solution is produced. The details of this
acceleration mechanism are presented in Section 4.5.
4.5. Enhancement
Instead of terminating the algorithm when the bounds
are equal, we introduce a (1 À e)-optimal solution method
to accelerate the convergence of TBCS, i.e., TBCS terminates
when the upper bound reaches 1 + e of the lower bound.
Let the global optimal objective value be G 6 UB, we have

5. Illustrative simulation results
In this section, we present illustrative simulation results to show how the proposed channel scheduling
scheme is able to achieve UEP, and how TBCS ﬁnds the global solution with much lower complexity than exhaustive
search method. In order to evaluate both the effectiveness
and efﬁciency of our proposed scheme and algorithm, we
have compared them with exhaustive search method,
which always achieves the optimum with the highest computation complexity. Besides, we have also compared them
with Min–Max channel scheduling scheme (which selects
antennas in the ascending order of the maximal PER of
each row in matrix BLÂK, and the inspiration comes from
[31]) and random channel scheduling method (RCS, which
randomly assigns a transmit antenna for each video layer
and it is similar to PT MIMO [18]). The video sequences,
mobile, foreman and crew, are tested. These sequences are
selected because of their different characteristic motion
and spatial details. All test sequences are 300 frames with
a frame rate of 30 fps and encoded by the JSVM reference
encoder [4] to generate an embedded scalable video
stream with eight layers.
We assume that the channel conditions of the users are
independent. For user k (1 6 k 6 K), the MIMO channel is
under independent Rayleigh fading, and elements in channel matrix Hk are obtained from Clarke and Jakes’ model
[32]. Noise vector fk is from i.i.d. Gaussian collection with
zero mean, independent real and imaginary parts, with
variance r2. Equal power is allocated to each transmit antenna and 16-QAM is used for modulation. Also, RS codes
[33] are adopted to protect the transmitted bit streams
since it maintains maximum erasure protection while produces a minimum of redundancy. We allocate the same
channel codes for all video layers. Although unequal power
allocation and channel coding can also achieve UEP, these
methods are beyond the scope of this paper. In this paper,
we focus on achieving UEP only through channel scheduling and it can be easily incorporated into these existing
UEP schemes. For the detection of transmitted video signals, linear ZF receivers [34] are adopted.

5.1. Complexity analysis
We conduct experiments to show the computational
complexity of TBCS versus exhaustive search method. The
number of iterations is adopted as the comparison criterion. Fig. 4 illustrates the iterations of both exhaustive
search method and TBCS under different number of video
layers with the number of transmit antennas Mt = 4. The
ﬁgure shows that exhaustive search method always has
higher iterations than TBCS. In order to ﬁnd the global optimal solution, exhaustive search method has to search the
whole solution space, whose space size is M Lt . While the
computational complexity of TBCS is mainly depending
on the tightness of both the upper and lower bounds,
branching and pruning techniques, and parameter e. Their
effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation results
in the next subsections. In the case that e = 0, TBCS ﬁnds
the optimal solution, but it has much lower complexity

than exhaustive search method, this also demonstrates
the efﬁciency of TBCS.
From this ﬁgure, we also ﬁnd that the iterations gap between exhaustive search method and TBCS is becoming
bigger as L increases. This is mainly because that in
exhaustive search method, the number of iterations is only
depending on the number of video layers when Mt is constant, and it is increasing exponentially. While in TBCS, the
video layers have been mapped to antennas orderly. Thus,
when some important video layers (base layer and some
relative low enhancement layers) are mapped to antennas
with very poor channel quality, many nodes would be
pruned from the branch and bound tree through the pruning
procedure. This greatly reduces the searching space and
computational complexity.

5.2. BER performance
We then compare both the short-term and long-term
average BER of different schemes. The number of transmit
antennas is four and the number of video layers is eight in
the simulations. Elements in channel matrix Hk are obtained from Clarke and Jakes’ model [32]. For purpose of
clarity, the parameter e is set to zero in TBCS, and we only
plot the average BER of four layers (the lowest two layers
and the highest two layers, i.e., the base layer, enhance-1,
enhance-6 and enhance-7) of different schemes in this
subsection.
The short-term average BER of video layers with average SNR = 20 dB is illustrated in Fig. 5. The ﬁgures clearly
demonstrate that the short-term average BER is timely
ﬂuctuated from 10À6 to 100. Thus, video layers should be
mapped to different transmit antennas according to their
importance. Specially, in order to protect base-layer bit
stream during bad status, mapping it to the best antenna
is indispensable. In RCS scheme, all video layers are treated
equally and mapped to transmit antennas randomly. The
average BER of all video layers are ﬂuctuated from 10À6
to 100 as Fig. 5(a) shows, and UEP is not achieved. The
Min–Max scheme assigns the antennas to video layers in
the ascending order of the maximal PER of each row in matrix BLÂK [31], and the average BER of video layers is
illustrated in Fig. 5(b). The ﬁgure shows that the average
BER still does not strictly have the same order with that
of video layers’ priorities. However, when compared with

RCS, important video layers are given more protection in
some degree. For example, the average BER of the lowest
two layers is generally lower than the highest two layers.
Our proposed branch-and-bound algorithm ﬁnds the optimal video-layer-antenna mapping order and Fig. 5(c)
shows its average BER results of different video layers. This
ﬁgure obviously manifests that an unequal average BER
according to the importance of bit stream is accomplished.
However, at some points, such as when t = 0.2 and t = 0.9,
the average BER of lower video layers is not always lower
than that of higher layers. This is because channel scheduling is a non-linear mapping problem due to the interdependence among video layers, and simply mapping video layers to multiple antennas according to the order of
average BER is only a feasible solution. Though it cannot
guarantee the solution’s optimality, it generally achieves
much better performance than RCS. This is why we adopt
the average PER as the criterion to denote antenna’s channel quality and ﬁnd an upper bound of the average overall
distortion in TBCS, the details have been explained in
Section 4.2.
We also compare the long-term average BER of each video layer under different SNR strength and the results are
illustrated in Fig. 6. In RCS scheme, the long-term average
BER will be converged since all the video layers are treated
equally and mapped to multiple transmit antennas randomly. Fig. 6(a) demonstrates this. The ﬁgure shows that
all video layers nearly have the same average BER, and
no UEP is achieved. On the other hand, the long-term average BER performance illustrated in Fig. 6(b) shows that low
video layers have lower average BER than the high layers in
Min–Max scheme. However, the gap of the average BER
among video layers is small. It is mainly because that
Min–Max only gives more protection to important video
layers in some degree, and it cannot guarantee that optimal UEP is achieved. In Fig. 6(c), we plot the long-term
average BER of TBCS. The ﬁgure clearly shows that UEP is
achieved, and the gap of the average BER among video layers is bigger than that in Min–Max scheme. When comparing all the three sub-ﬁgures in Fig. 6, we can ﬁnd that the
low average BER of the important video layers (e.g. base
layer, the ﬁrst enhancement layer) is achieved by sacriﬁcing the BER performance of high video layers. This is reasonable in video communication since video signal
contains bits of different importance. And it is indispensable to protect the bits discriminatively and give more protection to the important bits.

5.3. Reconstructed video PSNR performance
We conduct experiments to show the reconstructed
average overall PSNR of the decoded video sequences over
various average SNR strength and number of receivers.
Three video sequences, mobile, foreman and crew, are
tested and encoded into eight layers.
First, we evaluate the reconstructed average PSNR performance over various SNR strength and the results are
illustrated in Fig. 7. The number of receivers K = 50 and
parameter e = 0. All the three ﬁgures, Fig. 7(a–c), undoubtedly show that the PSNR improvement is achieved by TBCS
against both RCS and Min–Max schemes. The performance
improvement is from the obtained UEP, which is achieved
by adaptive channel scheduling. Particularly, the gap of
PSNR among the schemes in the low SNR region is outstanding since the high BER makes it indispensable to give
more protection to the important video layers. As the average SNR strength increases, the superiority of channel
scheduling becomes inconspicuous. Suppose that SNR
strength of any antenna is high enough to broadcast video
layer reliably, channel scheduling is becoming unnecessary. Therefore, the gap of PSNR among the schemes is very
small in the high SNR region.
We also compare the schemes under different numbers
of receiver, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 8. The
average SNR strength is 20 dB and parameter e = 0. From
the ﬁgures we ﬁnd that PSNR is decreasing as the number
of users K increases. The reason is that the heterogeneity of
channel condition is becoming considerable as the number
of users increases, and the performances of all schemes are
deteriorated. When the number of users K is large enough,
the quality differentiation among antennas is becoming
inconspicuous since each antenna is corresponding to K
subchannels, and the gap of PSNR among the schemes becomes small. Meanwhile, the ﬁgures also clearly show that
TBCS always performs the best, this demonstrates the
effectiveness of TBCS under various channel conditions.
We then examine the inﬂuence of parameter e on received video quality. The video sequence, crew, is tested,
and the number of users K = 50. Fig. 10 plots the average
PSNR of the reconstructed video given different e. The ﬁgure
shows that average PSNR decreases as e increases. The reason is as follows. When e = 0, TBCS ﬁnds the optimal solution and has the same PSNR performance with exhaustive
search method. When e > 0, TBCS terminates when

mal solution is produced, which is equal to the upper bound
of the distortion. As e increases, the algorithm converges
more quickly with higher distortion. From Fig. 4 and
Fig. 10, we can also conclude that TBCS is ﬂexible to various
applications. For example, if the applications require high
video quality, the parameter e should be set small. On the
other hand, if the applications require low delay, e can be
set big relatively.
At last, we investigate the reconstructed video PSNR
performance of TBCS against the channel estimation error.
In Fig. 9, we show the results with perfect channel matrix
Hk versus channel estimation error where Hk is estimated
by ML. Moreover, to investigate the robustness of TBCS under heavy estimation error, we also plot results when we
add 15% disturbances to the feedback SNR strength. Specifically, from the channel matrix, we get the SNR strength of
each antenna according to Eq. (2). Then, each of the SNR
strength cik is disturbed by randomly adding a noise, and
the noise is a variable randomly selected from the range
of [À0.15 Ã cik, 0.15 Ã cik]. At last, the performance of RCS
is illustrated as the benchmark. The ﬁgures show that
when channel matrix is estimated by ML, the PSNR performance is very close to the case when channel matrix is
known perfectly. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed scheme and algorithm in practical applications. When the estimation error is heavy which is simulated by adding 15% disturbances to the feedback SNR
strength in our experiments, the PSNR is close to RCS, but
it is never worse than RCS. This is because when the estimation error is too big, it provides little useful information
for optimizing channel scheduling and the channel scheduling result is similar to RCS. This demonstrates the robustness against channel estimation error.

computational complexity is very high by using exhaustive
search method. Instead, by adopting the branch-andbound framework, an efﬁcient low-complexity channel
scheduling algorithm is proposed. Moreover, at the expense of performance loss, the complexity is further reduced by relaxing termination condition of TBCS, and a
(1 À e)-optimal solution is produced. Our proposed scheme
is very ﬂexible that UEP is achieved only by switching the
video layers among multiple antennas. It can be easily
incorporated into most of the existing UEP video transmission schemes. At last, simulation results demonstrate both
the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our proposed scheme
and algorithm.
